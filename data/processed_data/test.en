When an English speaker realises that a foreign person they are speaking to doesn't understand one of their sentences, they repeat it, the same way, but louder, as though the person were deaf. At no point does it come to their mind that their vocabulary might be complicated or that their expression might most probably be ambiguous to a foreigner and that they could reword it in a simpler way. The result is that not only does the person still not understand, but they get irritated at being considered deaf.

I know you don't live here anymore.
Say which you would like.
I'm really going to miss Tom.
His irresponsibility astounds me.
Mary married me this morning.
Are you sure we have enough water?
I've finished the job.
Her face was bright with happiness.
Have you told Tom why you need to go to Boston?
Trade between two countries can be complex.
How do you say that?
This woman is blind.
Why does Tom do that that way?
I'll call you later from the office.
He said he'd been busy.
Tom doesn't go swimming very often.
It didn't happen like we'd hoped.
Tom won't escape punishment.
Why are you with me?
We've got to hurry.
Tom didn't want the same thing to happen to him.
Tom won't have to go there anymore.
And nobody helped you?
Tom and Mary are getting married in three months.
Is Tom planning to do that today?
It feels like rain.
Can she ride a bicycle?
I'm overreacting.
My grandfather doesn't know how to take money out of an ATM.
Mary swims as fast as Jack.
Tom called Mary as soon as he got to Boston.
Tom didn't have to apologize.
Did Tom really dance?
Do you like this perfume?
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
Tom is a very wealthy man.
Will Tom be in Boston next year?
Tom is a very talented musician, too.
I certainly hope Tom doesn't leave.
What am I doing?
Tom married a widow.
Tom hasn't committed any serious crimes.
You're older than her.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
Didn't you know Tom was still living with his parents?
You knew I wouldn't do that.
Even adults do a lot of stupid things.
Tom fixes things.
Tom is a common name.
It is up to you.
In my place, Tom would've done the same.
Are these suitcases yours?
We wish you a pleasant journey.
No one said anything to me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Tom asked me to tell you that.
Tom is getting worse, isn't he?
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
How many magazines are on the desk?
I'll lay the table.
You can go now if you wish.
The circumstances of his death have not yet been clarified.
Tom said that he didn't want to go with us.
Put on your uniform.
I told him where we'd gone.
There's a fork in the road here.
I didn't touch your guitar.
What do you learn at school?
I beat my personal record yesterday.
Who gave it to them?
The teacher has given Tom permission to do whatever he wants.
I assure you I did not do it purposely.
I’d suggest a comma.
This story is based on a true story.
We're unimaginative.
I am ready to go with you.
Tom did his best to help Mary learn French.
I was very sad.
I am not willing to shed the blood of the innocent to achieve my goal.
I invited my neighbors to dinner.
Should we start?
Tom told Mary to keep the windows opened.
Tom likes talking about Mary.
No one ever taught me anything.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
We text each other all the time.
What a rude man!
I accept your apology.
We are both her boyfriends.
Are you ambitious?
This is just a hobby for me.
They became man and wife.
I bit into my sandwich.
If Tom didn't do that, then who did?
Tom is a good partner.
He worked more than five hours on end.
Who did you buy those flowers for?
Where should I look for it?
Tom wasn't able to make Mary laugh.
Say it isn't true.
I just got a call from your school.
You've got to see this.
Mary massaged Tom's temples.
I have one elder brother and a younger sister.
Life doesn't always work out the way you want it to.
Where did she decide to go?
Selling cars is my job.
Tom and Mary are lying.
Tom doesn't want people asking so many questions.
During the night it's very cold.
Who knows you have this?
In case the alarm rings walk, don't run.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I try to brush my teeth after every meal.
Tom lives in a small apartment on Park Street.
He threw a stone into the pond.
"I see," said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw.
Is she beautiful?
You should've kept it secret.
My little brother can read English.
I knew I should've stayed at home.
Tom didn't work alone.
Let's forget about what was yesterday.
Underline unfamiliar words.
How much is an apple?
Two shirts and suits, please. There's a stain here.
The bed I slept in last night wasn't very comfortable.
Last year, I was in Australia.
Sales are down.
Why do you give him money?
"What's your name?" "Tatoeba." "Is that your real name?" "No."
I know people find that odd.
What did you recommend?
It won't be easy persuading Mary to go.
Tom doesn't have a television.
I think that that won't work.
I made that for Tom.
I feel a pain in my back.
Tom gave me his old one.
You're always saying that.
I am sure of her success.
I know that won't happen again.
I played with friends.
You should've come by train.
The trouble is that you are too young.
She worships him.
Tom spent quite a lot of money for his house.
He's going to come back right away.
Be careful if you go out.
Better a hundred friends than a hundred rubles.
You really are stupid.
Most people aren't that stupid.
Hi Tom, and welcome to Tatoeba!
Who knows!
Would you please send this letter by airmail?
Work makes life sweet.
She wants to be a singer.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
Are you hiding from Tom?
Doing nothing is the easiest thing to do.
You want to be lawyers.
I want to go back to my room.
The novel ends with the heroine's death.
Tom finished his drink and then ordered another one.
Tom won't be here all week.
I believe this is the only thing I can do for you.
Please go away.
Tom has already talked to me.
Be careful. It's spicy.
They never talk about their childhood.
Tom isn't answering his phone.
She is herself again.
I almost never leave the house anymore.
Listen!
Don't blame your mistakes on me.
How does one use this camera?
I've done the same.
Aren't you going to the theater tonight?
I wanted to go by train.
Tom never asked how Mary had died.
Your father is a physicist.
Are you selling your car?
What was she doing in your room?
He narrowly escaped death.
We never got an answer from them.
I thought you were working.
Tell them where you are.
Can you talk to Tom about this?
When will we go back?
I'm very happy.
Tom gives me a lot of advice.
Any watch will do as long as it is cheap.
He greets everyone loudly.
I need somewhere to stay.
It's a good school.
Someone left you a message.
Tom told me he called you.
You’re not blind, are you?
Tom and I have been friends for many years.
Unless caught stealing, one is not a thief.
This is interesting.
He was completely cleared of the charge against him.
Tom was very kind to everyone.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
Is it a phenomenon, or a noumenon?
You said it was a joke.
Tom wanted to be a pharmacist.
You and me cannot disobey this order, as it comes from a superior officer.
I kissed her on the forehead.
Of course I was joking.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
I think Mary is in her office.
That's the house they were living in.
The police found a blonde hair in the sink.
Tom made it clear that he didn't want me here.
Now you're an adult.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
Watch what you're doing. You almost killed Tom!
Don't you wish you were going with me?
Tom had to cut the class in order to meet us.
I lol'd.
Do you want me to be happy?
What team do you cheer for?
I'm drunk again.
I don't leave my door unlocked anymore.
Tom is most likely at home.
Hey, give that back to me.
I like her already.
Tom has a bald spot.
Tell her to be here by 2:30.
She had to part with her fur coat.
My computer crashed and now it won't boot up.
Tom stood up for me.
Tom saw it.
She has many friends in the United States.
Tom shouted at us in a gruff voice.
I think she is charming and attractive.
Haptic sensations defy precise description.
It's a complicated question.
Are you fasting?
Just trust me.
I didn't call Tom.
It doesn't look like you're worried.
I don't think I'd have the courage to do that.
Do you think I don't know about you and Tom?
I'd like to watch this movie again.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
Get them some food.
Tom isn't in very good shape.
If you know who killed Tom, you should tell the police.
You did something that I would never do.
You can call me Bob.
I don't want to answer the question.
My father is going for a walk in the park.
Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early.
Are you American?
Tom hasn't regained consciousness.
Haven't you read this book?
Why don't you let her go?
They are still looking for the child.
Tell me where I can find it.
My glasses are on my nightstand.
I still can't believe Tom and Mary got married.
Why are they saying that?
Do you want to live in Madrid?
There were witnesses.
I'm home, Mom!
I'm not used to it, so it's a little tough.
Not everyone in town likes me.
The doctor advised him to abstain from drinking.
You should relax.
I didn't want him to see me like that.
This isn't the time for stupid jokes.
I'm probably wrong.
She isn't my type at all.
Did you want to come in?
How can you go on so blithely, pretending nothing's wrong, when something so horrible has happened?
I promise to work hard.
I'm glad that you came.
Did Tom wait?
I know that I have many faults.
I want you to be human.
I work as an air traffic controller.
He gestures when he speaks.
Call me tonight.
You told me it wouldn't rain today, so I didn't bring an umbrella.
Sorry that I love you.
Tom is going to tell Mary tomorrow.
Are you heading somewhere?
They know where you are.
Mary sat under the tree, reading an old book from the nineteenth century.
We certainly can't blame you.
Tom got tired of waiting, so he left.
I'm done here.
I haven't found a good place to pitch our tent yet.
I think that would help.
Where's your other brother?
He's a programmer.
How many Eskimos live in Greenland?
Have you betrayed me?
Tom bought a bottle of red wine.
I'd like to borrow your car tomorrow.
I'd like to speak with him.
What kind of cars do you like?
Tom forgave me.
He has plenty of money in the bank.
I don't like science.
I wonder who planted these trees.
I want to go home.
She was astonishingly beautiful.
Tom went to Mary's funeral.
Tom doesn't want to go there alone.
Have you seen him today?
I can't stand being treated like a child.
I'm not sure I trust her.
I went out with my overcoat on for fear of catching cold.
Return at once.
You must think I'm crazy.
The vase broke into a thousand pieces.
I should've done that last week.
There were two red hats on this table two hours ago.
Are you really that stupid?
You could go back to Boston if you wanted to.
I'm going to bed, because tomorrow I must get up early.
I'll stay with you until Monday.
It's getting ridiculous.
The bus was late.
Mary is a rich girl.
I don't want you to give up.
I know that you're busy.
Which one will you choose?
God helps those who help themselves.
Pull the rope tight.
Don't interfere with my studying.
I thought you had lost your watch.
She told me she was healthy.
Contrary to expectations, he was on time.
I think I fell asleep during class.
I'm trying to eat fast.
Are you busy today?
That's not your fault.
I swam very well when I was a child.
The two left.
I can't put up with him any longer.
Let's come up with a new plan.
Why are you awake?
It's pretty freaking cold outside.
Tom's parents were doctors.
The baby's age is now two years.
Come on, how often do you think a fictitious character needs to change clothes?
When do you want to go to Barcelona?
He sometimes eats lunch there, too.
We must go.
Did you recognize them?
You will eat my pears.
I always wear a hat in the summer.
I'm a student, but he isn't.
Do as he says.
She sews with a needle and thread.
Tom is the one who told me that.
Tom and Mary are watching TV and eating potato chips.
Tom saw us do that.
Tom told me that he didn't want to tell Mary.
Did you say anything to her?
Tom handed Mary a thick gray envelope.
I find foreign languages very interesting.
Leave a message after the beep.
It's too expensive.
My real name has nothing to do with my nickname.
Tom doesn't have to go if he doesn't want to.
I'll read it to you.
You're a bit taller than I am.
I don't understand why.
Those are just empty threats.
Nobody's going to hire you.
Tom is checking his mailbox.
I told Tom I wanted to go to Boston.
Tom did warn them.
His father won't come, he is very busy.
We have to be prepared to cope with violent storms.
There's something that I've been wanting to say to you for a long time.
Tom is only pretending to be sick.
I know how much she meant to you.
I didn't ask Mary who she was planning on going to Boston with.
I wrote a letter.
You're going to ruin your eyes.
Call me when you get there, so I know you're safe.
Look! The airplane is taking off.
I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your party.
Tell her it's not your fault.
Playing a computer game, Tom took Boston.
I don't want to give you my money.
He'll help.
If I didn't enjoy doing this, I wouldn't be doing it.
Don't call him a freak.
They made the decision.
She was ashamed.
I can't buy this because I don't have enough money.
Tom is awake.
I don't know what got into them.
Is money important for me?
I want you to do nothing.
Tom is growing a beard, isn't he?
Sixty minutes make an hour, and a minute is made up of sixty seconds.
I will follow you until death, Georges!
We saw them on TV.
I told you not to give up.
Tom isn't weird.
What'll become of me?
Tom got back from Boston on Monday.
There is nothing to be done about that.
I let him spend the night in my house.
May I introduce my friend to you?
That's my boy.
Tom said that he was really cold.
Don't be so narrow-minded!
There is a lot of food and bottles of wine on the table.
We will be happy to help.
The pollution worsens with each year.
This is our last day together.
It's not weird.
She needed rest.
Ten years ago, our parents died in a car crash.
I seldom go to church.
Tom was reaching for his gun when Mary shot him.
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.
Tom and Mary kept quiet.
I have done the best I could to help you. The rest is up to you.
Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in the water.
Tom is more experienced in business than I am.
Tom said he wished he were rich.
I'm worried about Tom's health.
Did I tell you that I'm claustrophobic?
It's an interesting book.
If you are free, come around to see me.
Fire engines have priority over other vehicles.
I can't make you any promises.
Tom has shaved off his mustache.
Most of my classmates can speak French quite well.
You're disgusting.
The week is finally over.
I thought it was pretty obvious.
We like Chinese food.
In the past, it's been very difficult to get tickets.
I thought that you knew that.
Control yourself!
This is all we can give you.
Tom used to get up early.
We're not afraid of new elections.
She attempted to swim across the Thames.
Tom freed one of his slaves.
I didn't get the joke.
Are you still in Scotland?
Fashion is a fickle thing.
Are you Canadian?
Tom knew I was depressed.
Tom baked brownies.
These shoes are too large for me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Owing to bad weather, I didn't go.
There's nothing in the trunk.
Who are you going out with?
Excuse me, but I'm tied up now.
I will try not to disturb you while you are studying.
I'll go and look for him.
I baked a cake for her.
I've told you everything I know about Tom.
I was going to call him.
I don't feel like going out for a walk.
The store is almost empty.
Can we swim here?
Tom has a son whose name is John.
Trains don't go there.
He'll make a good lawyer sooner or later.
Nobody knows why Tom left the city.
I am calling back my wife.
What does Tom expect from you?
Tom gave Mary a potted plant.
Mary put the book in her bag.
Tom walked ahead of us.
This morning, I left for school without washing my face.
I'll probably see you tomorrow.
He saw the cat.
I respect them.
I thought you wouldn't come.
Did you go anywhere on Thanksgiving Day?
We knew Tom would win.
I did not betray you.
It took me three hours to get here from Boston.
Why don't you get into the pool?
We were ordered to do that.
Do you remember her?
Tom turned to Mary for advice.
I have a daughter who's married to a Frenchman.
Tom was shocked to learn that Facebook collected so much information on him.
What does it actually mean?
"Fourscore and seven years ago, our forefathers owned a bunch of scrubs." "Harkinian, that's not right and you know it." "Quiet! I'm enjoying my tale, so let me tell my story."
Tom bought a round-trip ticket to Boston.
This is the American Embassy.
Mary often sings in her car.
Donkeys are tough animals.
I got a new camera.
Leave it closed.
Give me a visual.
He cannot have done it by himself.
I don't want to live that way.
That problem still hasn't been solved.
There are two ways of doing this.
You'd better ask him first.
It most definitely doesn't mean that our men are kept primarily for breeding stock and procreation.
We played baseball.
Come quickly!
It's a matter of taste.
Tom will unlikely win.
This has never happened before.
He got his ears pierced.
You are mistaken about that.
There's a pile of letters on my desk that I have to answer.
That's your favorite, right?
Tom's living room was tastefully furnished.
She began to cry in a loud voice.
I figured it was easier to do it this way.
Do you go to school on foot every day?
He ran at the sight of the policeman.
Tom sang three songs and then left the stage.
He hugged his dog.
Tom will tell you what to do.
Tom wasn't poisoned.
I'm afraid they do not read much.
Look, he's coming.
What time is your plane landing?
Then who?
What color are the walls in your room?
Tom told us to do it.
Tom doesn't know what kind of person Mary is.
I couldn't bring myself to call on him.
Tom and I both said no.
When is her birthday?
Yes, tomorrow is my day off.
I want you to watch this video.
When did you begin studying French?
I've written to everyone.
Do you want to lose weight?
Do you think it's possible?
That made me smile.
Tom can't find his shoes.
Tobacco smoke causes cancer.
Tom certainly has a better understanding of this matter than I do.
She is still a girl.
That has nothing to do with you.
I think I'd like to marry her.
The orchestra's tuning up.
I didn't want to lose him.
Tom refused to compromise.
How do I thank you?
I'm not sure I want Tom working for us.
Can you lend me a stapler?
What's in the box is none of your business.
What does it involve?
We won't give her anything.
The wind calmed down.
I've known Tom my whole life.
I didn't want Tom to go to Australia with me.
Today's your lucky day.
I know you miss your family.
Is that your real name?
The policeman asked the girls if that car was theirs.
We'll have to do this quickly.
We must make a close analysis of the causes of the accident.
I hope that everything is in order.
I love cheese. My favorite is Camembert.
I have eight siblings.
She was satisfied with the new dress.
Sooner or later secrets become widely known.
Tom made a papier-mâché mask.
Tom seems to be anxious to get going.
If it's there, I'll find it.
My friend, what's making you so sad today?
Call me if you find anything.
She was not merely beautiful, but also talented.
What is the title of the book?
I don't think that Tom knows why you're here.
Aren't you from Boston?
I thought that you were right.
No one's forcing you to leave.
She pinched her sister.
Mary says she'll correct it.
Now it's time to leave.
I told her I wouldn't do it.
The sound of crickets chirping and frogs croaking lulls me to sleep.
Tom is able to skate.
The bread went hard.
I was invited to the party.
Especially do not feign affection.
This is an outright lie!
I felt attracted to Tom.
His face expresses deep sorrow and repentance.
I can't understand a single word.
Tom made breakfast for Mary.
Let's decide by coin toss.
I've already read the book you're talking about.
We don't get along very well with each other.
They're amazing.
My birthday is October 20th.
Don't listen to me!
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
May I have the menu, please?
I was just trying to impress him.
Gladiators fought in the Colosseum.
My mother is very pretty.
Tom suspected it might be a trap.
I didn't ask for your advice.
Tell them what you're doing here.
The story moved me to tears.
I thought you wanted to wait until Tom arrived.
He opened the door of the car.
How do you know why Tom did that?
Please don't tell anybody I did that.
I knew Tom would be heartbroken.
I was named after my great-grandfather.
Tom's boss is very demanding.
I didn't understand this part.
You'd better keep that a secret.
I told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
That's a debt I want to repay.
My best friend is a Canadian.
I had no idea you knew him.
I think the best is yet to come.
Who is playing the piano in the living room?
Use your key.
We told Tom that he wasn't welcome here.
Tom told Mary to behave herself.
We're professors.
But what does all this have to do with Tatoeba?
There were no more apples in the box.
Tom is celebrating, isn't he?
I can take him to the park.
Do you ever speak French with your parents?
She asked him to call her later.
People are still afraid to leave their houses.
Which color do you prefer, blue or green?
I forgot my bag.
That's the other reason I'm here.
Are you going anywhere on Monday?
Will Tom be on time?
I wasn't told the truth.
No one believes Tom.
Only three people bothered to reply.
I promise you I'll help him.
Did Tom tell you why he wasn't here?
Tom should know that already.
How many hats does your grandfather have?
We despise you for dropping bombs on defenseless people.
Tom isn't as rich as Mary.
Tom and I were unable to help Mary.
I do hope you'll come again.
Jim got a job as a waiter.
Don't tell him about this.
Tom said there was nothing to worry about.
I'm single and I've never been married.
I'll save you and Tom.
Are you attracted to Tom?
Tell me again.
Do good to those who hate you.
Mary bought what she wanted.
This waltz's melody always hypnotizes me.
Nothing can be better than that.
Last month we went to Manila.
You should have been more careful.
Tom didn't feel like waiting.
Are you still angry with her?
Do you believe these rumors?
I didn't see who was driving.
I want to know what I need to buy for the party.
I'm not sure Tom is going to survive.
Tom made the right decision.
Tom ran after the boys.
I want to hear your voice.
He's a year and five months old, but he can't walk yet.
I'll let Tom do it.
His father would never sanction his engagement to a girl who did not share the same religious beliefs as their family.
It wasn't you, was it?
Tom took a twenty dollar bill out of his pocket.
Thank you for your visit.
An hour spent in the garden is an hour well spent.
Who would've thought that Tom would change?
How can we get in?
Do you think there is another answer to this difficult problem?
I didn't sleep well the night before last, but I slept well last night.
They are doctors.
Mary told me she'd never done that before.
I went to Tom's graduation ceremony.
I think I'll be able to solve the problem by myself.
The statement imported that changes were necessary.
I heard Tom won't be at school tomorrow.
While you're young, you should read a lot.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
Keep quiet.
No matter how you do it, the results will be the same.
We don't trust Tom very much.
Don't take it wrong.
Tom ran to the station.
Go wake Tom up.
Her house is surrounded by a white fence.
She's hyperactive.
Tom certainly is aware of what happened here yesterday.
I'll do any kind of work.
I tried to find them.
If you want to sit down, sit down.
Tom had a big argument with Mary.
The first few years were difficult.
A customs official asked me to open my suitcase.
Do you know him well?
That guy is going places.
Will you go on a picnic with me?
Her father intends her to be a pianist.
The door is locked now.
Tom left his wife and children.
I am very grateful to you for what you've done for my family.
Two's company, three's a crowd.
Tell her what happened.
What will you eat tomorrow?
I'm looking for someone who can speak Portuguese.
Why don't we do what's right?
Money won't bring you happiness.
We can't avoid putting off our departure.
I like clocks.
Tom doesn't know how to tie a bow tie.
We know very little about it.
I told Tom no.
Let's find out for sure.
What are you looking for?
I want you to teach Tom how to drive.
Mary respects you.
I don't know when I'll be able to get back to Boston.
Tom is a natural-born teacher.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Did you go out?
I shut the door, but I haven't locked it.
Did you have time to write it down?
The surgery lasted six hours.
Go help Tom.
I know that you still love her.
I also found every letter he had ever written to my mother.
Three-fourths of the earth's surface is covered with water.
I think it wasn't the best idea.
Are you going to be free this afternoon?
I dug a pit.
Try to do one thing at a time.
You will speak Swedish.
Tom is worried about his health.
The food's not ready yet.
It's really not a good idea.
Why do you say one thing, and then go and do another?
I think Tom is still sleeping.
Tom isn't my classmate.
How are we going to get the piano upstairs?
Do you see what the problem is?
Take mine.
That's a fairly reasonable price.
The man was condemned to death.
I know Tom is a southpaw.
I don't think that's a good investment.
What time did you close the store last night?
Tom wasn't able to explain that.
My legs feel heavy.
Tom has to do this.
We're monks.
You told me that you were tired.
I almost won.
I'm only thirty years old.
Don't you want this?
Do you really want to help him?
Tom is still hiding.
I suggest you reconsider your decision.
Think about the safety of your passengers.
Tom isn't very good at his job.
What can they do to us?
We will fly in a helicopter.
Why did you help Tom escape?
Tell Tom he has to wash the dishes.
Tom doesn't drink now.
This will never happen again, I swear to you.

Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. [...] Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

I suppose you didn't even talk to Tom.
Why did you buy flowers?

Why didn't you shave?
Wait till the kettle begins to sing.
I don't know everything.
How long has it been since Tom left?
Tom tried to stay awake.
I'm working on that.

Whose bed is that?
We want Tom to help Mary.
I will never forgive you.
I'm writing a letter to my wife.
Take it easy.
Tom will be here when you come back.
Tom was still hungry.
Please don't speak so fast.
I didn't have a key.
Mary is a hottie.
I think I know where to find Tom.
Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm not afraid of growing old.
They woke up quite late.
He is dead drunk.
You can spend the night with us.
Tom's ugly.
It's unusual for him to get up early.
I don't know if there's time.
We didn't have enough money to do that.
We need to find work.
Tom did Mary a favor.
I still work here.
Tell Tom I'm not hungry.
Tom would be proud of you.
We can't go right now.
What if something happened to her?
I knew they would suspect him.
Which teachers were you talking to?
I won't let him do it.
Something wonderful happened today.
I'm older than you are.

He is the first Japanese that traveled in space.
I am a teacher, not a student.
You'll see everything yourself.
This is not my problem.
I lost the charger to my phone.
It's not quite as difficult to do as it sounds.
Why don't you ask them?
I didn't think you'd talk to me.
Your watch is five minutes slow.
Be a man.
Who did you kill?
They require me to work harder.
French from Quebec is spoken by more than 7 million speakers.
The ice will crack under your weight.
I've got business with Tom.
He traveled west by train.
It's a wonderful work of art.
I hope you'll be well soon.
You're getting more and more beautiful.
This is your big chance.
We're back together.
I am a genius!
I'm not as stubborn as you say I am, and you can't change my mind.
Going towards my house, I met her.
I made coffee.
I have a conservative neighbor.
Tom didn't know Mary was at the club.
Please take us there.
May I come tomorrow, too?
Tom refused to accept defeat.
Your face died, and I will replace your face with the greatest face in Koridai!
I think that that's an important point.
Is that one for sale?
The blast-off took place on schedule.
It used to be better.
I'm glad that you succeeded.
If I have the chance, I'll definitely travel to Beijing.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand French well.
You should have spoken more politely.
Your baby can walk.
Aren't you too young for that job?
It takes you an hour to go to the station on foot.
Control yourself!
What will you be doing on vacation?
Is there a logical explanation for this?
Call us.
Tom has been accused of cheating.
Can I have some?
I think it's time for me to move to the suburbs.
I wonder what Tom is hiding from me.
Do you remember how many apples were in the box?
I don't know anything about him.
Mary is picking berries in the forest.
I know nothing about you.
That was creepy.
I'm trying to enjoy life.
When can I see them?
I'll count up to three and if you won't give it to me willingly, I will take it from you.
Grab him! Don't let him get away.
Tom told Mary not to swim with John.
I wonder why Tom didn't stay in Boston for another week.
Tom said you liked baseball.
She knew she'd win.
We need another plan.
He has nine fingers.
This should be interesting.
I can help you learn Russian if you want.
We never do that.
Okey doke.
Everyone dies. I'll grow old too.

Tom will talk to Mary about that.
I can't budge it.
I think we spoke on the phone.
Did you know there were a few foxes living on this mountain?
She agreed with him.
Folks, let's live as good friends!

The design is quite interesting.
Whales are classified as mammals.
Is it too small?
He shoved his hands in his pockets.
Tell me about yourself.
We'd all be interested in hearing your opinion.
How much did you pay for those shoes?
I'm completely useless.
We don't have that.
You can't help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day.
Thank you very much.
I like this skirt. May I try it on?
I've heard rumors.
Tom is doing that already.
They aren't for you.
People are talking.
Show me how to play chess.
She allowed me to leave.
Now listen to me.
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening!
I have to trust her.
Tom didn't know that Mary had decided to quit her job.
Tom and Mary are now officially engaged.
They came back.
Tom and Mary apologized for not doing what they were supposed to do.
Why are you listening to them?
Will John come to see us tomorrow?
What's your favourite shoe colour?
A computer is a complex machine.
Who's to blame?
I think you should talk to him.
This isn't quite what I want.
Tom has a steady girlfriend.
Why did you help me?
I bought it from him.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
Tom has a large apartment.
Tom will stay with us.
I need a day off.
Tom told me to wait.
Why haven't you told them?
The airline lost my bags.
It was this boy that broke the windowpane.
I love my town.
I think I'll like being here.
You sound like a broken record.
I got my hair cut.
Do you want me to help you do that?
Why didn't we notice it before?
The lake was frozen, so we were able to walk to the island.
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
Show me the way, please.
Mary has been neglecting her children.
Is that what you're asking?
You're very old-fashioned.
I'd behave differently if I were you.
I came to see Tom.
Tom was waiting.
It would be good if I had a car.
Drive on.
May I have the floor?
I thought you said your name was Tom.
I was disappointed in you.
Tom returned three days later.
Make sure you tell him.
Pristina is the capital of Kosovo.
He took a taxi to get there in time.
I've been trying to find my keys.
This year unemployment will reach record levels.
If I want your opinion I'll ask you for it.
You are gorgeous.
I never form opinions on a topic I know nothing about.
Where shall we go now? To the theatre or cinema?
I was mistaken.
Don't do it!
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?
Florence was surrounded by walls.
We have every advantage over them.
As it got colder, I began to want a sweater.
I know you don't have time to help us.
She tried to stop him.
Would you prefer this one?
I prepared breakfast for you.
This one's different.
I agree.
Get your hands off Tom.
He has finished his work, hasn't he?
Mary won't do that herself.
Have you seen my son?
Polite people respect the rules of social decency by following good manners.
Tom shut the door and locked it.
You're not giving me what I need.

I am concerned about his health.
Tom spent his vacation with his family.
It's pretty odd.
Tom and Mary were tired of waiting.
She is the woman I will be marrying.
I have enough time for that.
I want you to think about this again.
Can you tell me what's wrong?
Thanks for letting me know.
No one moved.
Tom thought he was a cat.
Please don't ask me about him.
Tom is making a paper airplane.
I'd better take you home.
Why don't you join in the conversation?
I want you to promise me something.
She left the room without saying goodbye.
This may not be enough.
Are you going out tomorrow?
Don't go against the rules.
The cats are up on the roof.
There weren't any children on the bus.
Only I can do it. I did it alone.
Do one thing at a time.
Tom knows I'm older than he is.
Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?
I received her letter the other day.
Tom is Mary's former boyfriend.
I want to relax.
Next week I'll write an e-mail to my parents.
He dismissed most of his men.
I can't do that either.
He must not find out the truth.
I realized that Tom wasn't joking.
Why are you working here?
Tom likes to fool around.
Portugal is not an exception.
Drive cautiously.
Tom ordered his favorite dessert.
I am lazy.
I've heard all about you.
Do you think we have a chance to win?
We just don't know what happened.
Do you like this type of book?
Many buildings sustained substantial damage.
I sat on the bed's edge.
The parents want to give their son the best education.
Hundreds of people work in this factory.
I'm just looking for Tom.
"Tom, what are you doing?" "Nothing."
Do you know how much it cost me?
I thought somebody was there.
I didn't know that you wouldn't be there.
Don't do that anymore.
She started talking to a dog.
You're funny.
Take Tom away from here.
I've been working here for a couple of years.
Tom isn't watching TV now.
Don't touch my typewriter.
Get out of my house!
I know you miss your family.
We need you, Tom.
Tom can't hold his liquor.
We have no idea what to do.
Don't take it personally.
He engaged her as an interpreter.
Don't forget to call Tom.
I think we have enough.
I called Tom at work to tell him what had happened.
He can understand but he can't speak.
I need an envelope and a piece of paper. I also need either a pencil or a pen.
Have you tried turning it on?
You may talk as much as you like.
Everybody hide!
Now is not a very good time.
I'm watching the game on TV.
You yourself don't know what you're talking about.
The bell rang.
Tom gave the money back to Mary.
Do you really think I'm ready?
From now on, no more TV before you have done your homework.
Jack brushed the dust off his coat.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
Tom isn't too happy.
Am I clear?
You are good.
Superman can see through walls.
Do you like pineapples?
I usually take a bath after dinner.
He could do it.
I don't talk much.
Should I tell her to call you?
I don't think that this is a real diamond.
Where's Tom's watch?
I'm writing an article.
I've got work to do right now.
Tom didn't do that.
They heard Tom.
Did you wash these apples?
Who should we give it to?
You should learn how to control yourself.
Have you already been there?
My cat killed this mouse.
I wonder where Tom learned to do that.
It's impossible to dine at this restaurant without reservations.
I let them do it.
It would've been wrong to do that.
Three patients died last night.
Maybe you'd better go and see what Tom is doing.
I recognized you as soon as I saw you.
Never do anything just to show you can.
What prevented her from coming yesterday?
Tom was in the army.
You can ask Tom.
I've been wearing this coat for more than three years.
Come as fast as you can.
I barely know you.
Do you think I have to do that?
We live on planet Earth.
I bought it at the vintage clothing store.
I suspected that Tom had fallen in love with Mary.
When do classes start?
Tom went to Boston a month ago.
That's my younger sister's photograph.
What do you want me to ask him?
None were satisfied.
I had that feeling.
Tom's very good at mental arithmetic.
Tom was killed by his own gang members.
Tom said you speak French.
My daughter is still at work.
Did you bring what I asked for?
It happened in the blink of an eye.
The bottle was empty.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
I wasn't expecting that at all.
Graham Greene is a favorite author of mine.
He cannot walk, let alone run.
I have three times more money than you do.
The price of gold varies from day to day.
Tom unplugged the iron.
Take my advice!
Tom told us not to wait.
Are you still at work?
There is no rule without exceptions.
Tom said he needed to do that today.
Her English was better than mine.
I tried to hide.
Don't be like this.
I'm sure you'll like him.
You aren't allowed to bring food into the library.
The church is on the other side of the street.
Babies crawl before they walk.
Betty sat in the chair with her legs crossed.
Why were you in such a hurry?
They swam out to the island.
It's like summer outside.
You should have studied for the test.
This was easier than I thought.
Hey, it's my job.
How can I get Tom to fall in love with me?
Didn't you get a postcard from Tom?
As a lark, Tom bought Mary a plastic-grass hula skirt and a coconut-shell bra, momentarily forgetting that her opportunities to wear this colourful get-up would be somewhat limited.
Tom isn't a professional.
She is completely absorbed in a book.
It was a miscalculation.
Her fever subsided.
We don't want to go to your wedding.
Can I join you?
Oh no! Our patient is dead.
I don't think I'd want to do that.
We'll never forget what we heard.
Don't hate yourself.
You won't regret hiring him.
No weapon was found.
Did you know I'm French?
Tom was boring.
How much more money is it going to cost to finish building our house?
Do you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend? Where did you meet them?
That was your choice.
Rewrite it in your copybook please.
Patience begins where it ends.
I can't leave Tom there.
I haven't given it any thought yet.
Promises are made to be broken.
I just want you to love me.
Are you related to her?
I didn't think I'd get punished.
She got a flat tire on her way home.
You're a very beautiful woman.
Tom did a handstand on the beach.
Tom saw a mouse.
I know Tom kissed Mary.
It's really hard to choose.
I should've asked you before.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I've never smoked in my whole life.
I would never speak to you that way.
I thought you didn't know Tom.
Can I eat?
There are wounds that time does not heal.
Have you written your will?
I was starting to think Tom would sleep all day.
Tom abandoned his family and moved to Boston.
Her grave is there.
Take that one.
He held on firmly to the branch.
The terrorists attacked a mosque.
I didn't find it funny at all.
Correct me if I am wrong.
Is that the same guy?
Tom didn't tell anyone that he'd bought a diamond ring for Mary.
A great man doesn't care about his appearance.
She's a witch.
Why are people afraid of Tom?
Tell him to be careful.
Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
At last, we reached California.
Here's your order.
She seems rich.
Tom doesn't know how to relax and just enjoy life.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
You are the best.
That plan came to nothing.
Tom is always one step ahead of us.
I voted for you last year.
Who helped him?
I saw you spying on Tom.
I can't forget her eyes.
We do this every year.
Aren't you dressed yet?
The plane flew over Mt. Fuji.
What I really want is for Tom to teach me how to play a few chords on my guitar.
I sometimes struggle to speak French.
Who's coming?
Have pity on me.
Well, from time to time.
We're getting fat.
I've actually never seen it.
I don't want to miss my train.
Who's the lady that just came through the door?
We're discussing that.
I'm the one who told Tom he didn't need to attend today's meeting.
Their opposition broke down.
You know our rules.
Tom stayed outside.
What do you want to cook today?
I didn't understand your answer.
Send her home.
I've started to respect Tom.
Tom will explain it to Mary.
Quieter!
I'll help you clean your room.
What does it concern you? That's my business!
Tom and Mary just got married.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
As Tom said, this soup is too salty.
We're deaf.
Dibs.
Those two things aren't related.
I still haven't decided what to do.
Can you help us find her?
You were the last person to see Tom.
Did you receive my invitation?
It's because of you that we were late.
I love my sisters.
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
I can't translate this contract. It's in Italian.
This is our handbag.
She is a runner.
What are your aspirations for the future?
I'll tell them you called.
You're our only hope.
Tom and I bought our plane tickets three months in advance.
If I had to study, I would stay at home every day.
Why didn't you listen to her?
Tom has outlived three wives.
Tom ate all of Mary's yoghurt, but replaced it with the wrong brand.
Why don't you go on a diet?
We don't need you anymore.
Should I go tell them that?
I can't put up with that noise.
I am moving next month.
Tom suffers from cynophobia.
How old is your boy?
She bought a phone.
Tom didn't want to read a book.
Russian adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the nouns or pronouns to which they refer.
I'll tell you when to stop.
This is all for you.
She sat beside me in church.
Don't play here.
You shouldn't tell anyone about this.
Tom didn't want to sing, but Mary made him sing.
Were you looking for us?
I don't have anything to eat.
What makes you think I don't want to go?
If you have finished reading the book, return it to the library.
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
You speak French better than I do.
How do you know Tom likes Mary?
We've got to stay together.
Tom doesn't know how to take care of his children.
I can't see in because the curtains are closed.
Tom is taller than you, isn't he?
School is boring.
You've gotten hitched?
I walk faster than you.
Tom jumped out of the window.
His father always comes home late.
Thanks for lunch.
Because they are clean.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
I was weak.
Tom has wide shoulders and narrow hips.
You had no right to do that.
Have you eaten lunch?
I have a sore throat and a fever.
Tom was looking right at us.
Food prices will come down soon, won't they?
Mary pushed her hair away from her face.
She knows she needs help.
The boy talks like a great scholar.
It's not a good idea.
Don't stay out late.
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon.
What do you want to tell me?
Tom is bald.
It rained three days on end.
My leg was broken in a traffic accident.
I had help.
I think he can get along with his neighbors.
You need to be more creative.
You'll never believe what happened!
Tom wants to dance.
Don't get greedy.
Someone tried to kill me.
Did you turn off the living room light?
What can Tom do?
What do you think about the future?
I feel kind of sorry for Tom.
I'm giving my husband a massage.
My patience has come to the breaking point.
You should have seen the look on her face when she found out.
It's abundantly clear.
Tell him to get ready.
Are you related to her?
That's not cool.
Can you give that chair to her?
The radar broke.
I was in a plane crash.
I don't think Tom has to come tomorrow.
Who did it?
Didn't you know that he passed away about two years ago?
I made friends with Tom.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.
I want my 20 dollars back.
"Which one do you want?" "That one."
I don't trust banks.
Tom didn't eat breakfast.
It's very low.
I'm writing a letter now.
I want to be on the other team.
Tom hardly ever writes to his parents.
I didn't know we were supposed to do that.
Sorry I couldn't refuse her.
He's afraid of his father.
We're all inexperienced.
Maybe I can help you.
I asked around about her.
I saw your brother the day before yesterday.
We've put the Christmas presents under the tree.
Dan didn't even read the instructions.
Do you want a bag?
You gave me hope.
Tom was full of hatred for two women: He hated his wife and his mother for even longer.
Did you tell the police what Tom did?
I think we should let Tom know we'll be late.
It took me only three hours to do that.
Tell Tom that I want to go, too.
You all right?
He's voting.
Have you spoken with her?
Tom said he needed more money.
Foreign people intrigue me.
The cat closed his eyes and started to purr.
My wife is getting tired of the daily routine.
Tom is going back home tomorrow.
Tom zoomed in.
The soldiers were on the alert.
Tom rummaged through the drawer, looking for a pencil.
Don't embarrass me.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
His courage impressed me enough for me to trust him.
What company does he work in?
Smile!
It's not your money that I want.
What did you eat?
I haven't seen Tom for over three months.
I didn't know Tom would be alone.
Do you need keys?
This electric car is powered by batteries.
Allow me to introduce my wife to you.
My sister's son Jimmy is my favorite nephew.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
Tom found one.
I need you now.
You really think I can fly?
I think everyone is asleep.
Their goods are of the highest quality.
Write Tom a note.
You're a terrible cook.
For a wise person one word is enough!
I wouldn't have made it without you.
He's a slowpoke.
Too bad Schrödinger isn't around to see the increasing interest in his cat.
I told him to leave me alone.
The only thing that matters is whether or not you can do the job.
That's why he lost his job.
I really like the sun.
Don't give it to him.
Tom didn't go to the concert.
It wasn't difficult to understand.
How can you be so stupid?
I'm getting tired of this.
You'll get his letter soon.
I'd rather stay home than go alone.
Tom belongs to a secret society.
I still don't understand how it works.
You are reading my thoughts.
Please let me know when we get there.
I just don't believe you.
You were always in my thoughts.
I knew Tom wasn't going to sing.
What Tom said scared me.
Tom panicked and ran.
We will miss you terribly if you leave Japan.
Fasten your seat belt, please.
You mean nothing to me.
It's way too hot inside...
The Internet is a labyrinth.
Her hope didn't come true.
Please go on.
Tom doesn't want to go anywhere.
I don't worry about her.
Do you find Mary attractive?
Do you think Tom is unsociable?
Can I talk to you a sec?
The timetable was disrupted.
I slept all day yesterday.
It's so cute.
I didn't see anybody in the park.
Does Tom have an attorney?
I am divorced.
Tom fastened his seatbelt.
They told me to stay in the car.
Is this blackmail?
Finding her office was easy.
Does she understand Italian?
So you decided to come after all.
Do I look beautiful in this dress?
It drizzled this morning.
Do you want half of this cake?
I have another assignment for you.
Tom was involved in that scandal.
Don't you get bored when you're alone?
I want to have my own life.
Many children learn to use a computer even before entering school.
It is difficult for the Japanese to articulate the sound of the r.
I know Tom is thirty years old.
The young man knows the rules, but the old man knows the exceptions.
His daughter is not a child anymore.
I don't drink rum.
You lied to the FBI.
You have two options.
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Stability is in unity.
Why do you put up with that?
It's a catchy song.
O brave new world that has such people in't!
Have you seen any new movies lately?
Let Tom have his fun.
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
Tom didn't want to go to anywhere with us.
Tom got wounded.
Has Tom said anything more?
Is that pizza?
There was a great deal of conjecture as to what would happen.
I only have eyes for you.
He doesn't want to die.
He didn't deserve to die.
Mind your language.
I'm just a housewife.
Tom said that he's not planning to do that.
He will follow Tom.
If Tom and Mary could speak French, I'd hire them.
Tom has a brother and a sister.
Tom isn't a guest.
Put it on repeat.
If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to.
If you have a problem, ask Tom for help.
Tom made light of a difficult situation.
Can we postpone the meeting until tomorrow?
That happened on Park Street.
Tom died three days after Mary.
Tom is massaging Mary's shoulders.
Emo people wear black lipstick.
Are you in a hurry?
I will show you some pictures.
I know what those guys want.
I want to apologize to Tom for doing that.
He sings very well.
She is taller than Mary.
Stay here while I see what's going on.
Is this your tea?
Nobody told me you were here.
I'm a teacher myself.
Tom put on rubber gloves.
Tom wanted to hit Mary, but John stopped him.
You will always be welcome whenever you come.
We might even win.
Tom could be anywhere.
You must help me.
Mary said you were her friend.
You should've stayed with them.
Many children don't like vegetables, but my little brother loves them.
This will only take a minute.
He is employed on the farm.
I'm clever.
The island is easy to reach by boat.
I'm going to put this book back on the shelf.
My brother is in Australia now.
Did it work the way you wanted?
Tom can't deny that.
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
Get them away from me.
Are you from the future?
Hello. My name is John Reindle. I work at the American Embassy in Prague.

Mine is the best.
I'll try to protect you.
This isn't what I ordered.
Have you ever gone to Paris?
Don't worry. You can count on me.
Tom handed Mary a large envelope.
It's as easy as pie for Tom.
Maybe that won't happen.
Tom and Mary have been too busy fighting to notice how much they actually like each other.

How was your day?
My eyes aren't green.

We were cooking tempura at that time.

Why didn't you tell her this?
Tom has been living with us.
Oh, it's snowing!
It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
I thought it might be of some use.

What did Tom give you this time?
The Copts are the native Christians of Egypt.
Tom doesn't drink tea.
Tom thought Mary would cry.
That's where I met her.
Everytime her husband looked at me, he almost asked me: "For what purpose have you come here?"
A small pond is behind my house.
Who would you like to speak to?
That's just awful.
Tom even looked behind the door.
Please allow me to ask you a few questions.
I just did what Tom asked me to do.
It's way too heavy.
I like climbing trees.
Tom started packing his things up.
She made me swear not to say anything.
I don't think that Mary is beautiful.
I can't open my eyes.
Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting drowsy.
Tell the truth.
We'll stop them.
One day, her dream to be dressed in haute couture came true in an unexpected way.
I didn't go to the funeral.
Never say that.
It's phenomenal.
He told me that he was healthy.
It's me that's wrong.
I see a black horse.
Things had gone even better than I had imagined.
I thought you were older than me.
Tom fell asleep right away.
I couldn't help but smile.
I have something I want to tell you.
The best is often the enemy of the good.
Tom is ill.
Do you really think that?
Can we help?
Many Germans travel to Greece every summer.
No, I don't have it with me.
Kids go to school to study.
Night draws nigh.
I was very surprised by Tom's reaction.
My watch is ten minutes slow.
I'm trying my best to forget that.
I told Tom I had forgotten my password.
Were you the one who told Tom not to do that?
Bring it to me.
Would you like me to order it?
I was about to go out when he called on me.
They would never believe us.
I don't like being kept waiting.

Ask me again in October.
I'll tell you a story.
It was black.
He's thirteen.
I stayed at an inexpensive hotel when I was in Boston.
His hair was long last year.
You'd better tell me everything.
You did that on purpose.
You're first.
There was no one there but him.
She said she didn't need a lawyer.
Get out of here, now!
Tom has nothing to be ashamed of.
Tom and Mary are bad parents.
I know what Tom had to do.
Tom won't go with you.
The plane took off.
I'm having dinner.
I didn't know that you were French teachers.
Space before an exclamation mark is not needed.
I forgot that Cristina read English.
He loved his garden.
I'm dead.
Spend some money on yourself.
We know you're in pain.
You need to tie your shoelaces.
What was Tom accused of?
I wanted to say thanks.
Where is the bathroom?
I'd rather tell him in person.
We promised.
What's supposed to happen on Monday?
I didn't act quickly enough.
In any case, it's wrong to break a promise.
The mail arrives before noon.
Do I have to study?
Why are you apologizing?
I've already told you everything that I know about that.
That word is very difficult to translate.
Where is my ball?
Tom said he's glad that you're back.

I bought a book yesterday.
Why did Tom come back?
I drank a liter of coffee.
Why should we study economics?
It was discreet of you to keep it a secret from him.
I'll sit on a tree stump and eat a pie.
Let's wait for Tom.
Who should I address the letter to?
Tom said I was ugly.
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday.
Did he already fall asleep?
If I want your opinion I'll ask you for it.

Could you give me a ride to the bus stop?
What's Tom listening to?
That sounds lovely.
I didn't feel like calling him.
I don't want to go without you, Tom.
If we decline, what are the alternatives?
We're all angry.
Let's swap places.
The game is not over.
Where's Mum?
Tom and Mary become friends right away.
I don't want to leave here.
I did that wrong last time.

I advise you to listen to us.
Tom went to the river bank.
I'm sick of your complaints.
Tom speaks French better than me.
The pizza tasted good.
Maybe I'll just give up soon and take a nap instead.
Tell Tom I don't want to talk to him.
What about?
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's husband?
I'm tired of watching television.
She committed suicide by jumping off the bridge.
I think I miscalculated.
Which game did you choose?
If I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anyone else?
Do you know whether or not it'll rain tomorrow?
I still don't understand what you want from me.
I know that Tom didn't win.

My birthday is on March 22.
I'll ask Tom the next time I see him.
Tom is now in Australia.
I suspect that Tom did that just to get some attention.
Have you already talked to him?
I love to watch anime.
I filled the pool with water.
That man is strong.
In the tent we talked and talked.
They greeted us in French.

Out of the way!

What do you have to do?
That would be rude.

Whether we like it or not, we have to go there.
We can't stay here any longer.
Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
She asked me if I knew him.
Tom was here at the time.
He's now as tall as his mother.
You look young for your age.
Are you watching TV?
Send us your photos.
This book is surprisingly easy to read, isn't it?
I have a gift for you.
I am not your enemy.
Be careful not to slip!
I asked her.
I want to tell you everything.
Do you mind if I turn on the TV?
I felt like talking to someone.
OK then, I'll get out of your hair.
She wants someone to love her.
Please tell me.

Your house is on fire.
Finding a place to park might be a problem.
I hope the bus will come before long.

Let them know.
That's your opinion.
I have a meeting at 2:30.
I'll probably see you tomorrow.

Now it is half past three, but we booked a place at the restaurant at 8 o'clock
Tom got out of the bath, dried himself off, and put his clothes on.
Are you sure Tom is the person you saw?
Just listen to him.
You're very absent-minded.
I do not agree with you.
We can give it a try.
Stay here with them.
Being very tired, I went to bed early.
I'm useless.
They took Tom away on a stretcher.
They need a hero.
You should've left earlier.
Tom dressed hurriedly.
I didn't want to kill her.
Tom went with Mary.
You must never resort to force.
A beard does not make a philosopher.
Do you have any aspirin?
They didn't find her.
They need to go.
Get my horse ready at once!
He's too drunk.
Tom looks like a girl.
He may have already departed.
I put those photos on my webpage.

It cost too much.
I hate tomatoes.

No one knows her.
I think the love of money is common to us all.
Tom won't have to pay for it.
Is that why you came?
You're all crazy.
I don't know anything about Tom's plans.
I'd do that again if I had to.
Compared to those around him, he looked really happy.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
Tom will be thirteen next year.
Give me your book.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
If you're not willing to help, get out of my way.
I'm in the taxi.
You aren't alone.
Tom wants to work in a hospital.
You're still too young.
You'll see everything yourself.
Do you not have your own opinion?
This earth is moist owing to the recent rain.

I'm forgetful.
He is losing his hair.
I asked Tom where he had gone.
This is a business paper.
You're too young to go there alone.
Tom and I like to dance.
They all giggled.
I am not taller than he, either.
We don't have the time to discuss this right now.
You're way younger than Tom.
Rumors have been circulating.
It's extremely unfair.
I am an optimist by nature.

Tom told everyone I was adopted.
I know you can do it.
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
She goes to the dentist regularly, so she seldom gets toothache.
How does this affect me?
I'm going to throw this away.
I need someone to protect me.
I shouldn't even be telling you this.

I think I'll take this tie.
Who are you to judge?
It looks strange.

All of the shop's staff were pleasant people.
I have just read this book.
I want a scooter.
Mary gave him a little kiss on the cheek.
What happened the next day?
I'll never forget the look on Tom's face the first time that I hugged him.
It smells so good.
How much money do we need?
Let me help him.
Do you have anything to say to us?
I knew Tom wasn't very reliable.
I am a Polish journalist.
My hobby is listening to music.
I would like to see Mr Holmes.
Tom got in his car and went home.
Did you find anything in the room?
Tom doesn't know what to do with all his money.
I've been living in Boston for almost three years.
Tom is just bored.
When will you be in London?
I'm thinking.
Tom will pick me up at 2:30.
I didn't think I was going to get caught.
I forbid you to leave the house.
Am I older than you?
Could you loan them money?
The pan is too hot.
Don't follow fashion.
Do it as you are told.
You mustn't despise him because he didn't win a prize.
What is the file extension?
They abandoned you.
Germany adjoins the Netherlands.
Didn't you know Tom didn't like to do that?
I'm not sure how accurate that is.
Stay here and wait a bit.
Thousands of people lost their jobs.
It's not easy to speak a foreign language.
I'll call you in the morning.
I'll do it manually.
I knew you'd come home.
She is about your age.
I'm so grateful for you.
I'm not sure that I share your optimism.
Didn't you see Tom yesterday?
You were definitely drugged.
I promised him I'd go to the show with him tomorrow.
I'm very sleepy and it's late.
He said he was very tired.
You're vain.
Tom wasn't married.
I hope you like the job.
It won't last forever.
I probably should have said something.
You have three messages.
I don't want to do this here.
He's intelligent, but lazy.
Are you winning?
No one was prepared for what happened next.
Mary told me why she didn't want to do that.
I did that here yesterday for the first time.
Can you find it?
Tom asked us not to do anything.
What did you expect to happen?
An honest man never steals money.
Who is your favourite actor?
We'll be OK.
None of us could do what Tom asked.
I didn't want Tom to know I'd seen him.
On the whole I agree with you.
You understand more than me about this sort of thing.
That's common knowledge.
Give me a hand here.
Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient.
Are you allergic to any medicines?
Which color do you prefer, blue or green?
Tom doesn't come to visit very often.
I need to go now.

That gave me a lot of pleasure.
You could at least knock!

Who do you think we are?
Queen Elizabeth died in 1603.
He made me carry his baggage.
He isn't married.
The prey dies once, while the hunter dies every day.
Follow us.
Tom goes there every day.
You must go.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced that I'm right.
You'd better take your umbrella, just in case it rains.
Do you hear something?
I think it's unfair.
Do you believe in ghosts?
That's a day I'll never forget.
Let me stay.
The doctor used X-rays to examine my stomach.

Tom has gone to the store to buy some milk.
My hobby is weight lifting.
I'll never forget this.
Tom made light of a difficult situation.
We love each other, but she lives in Germany and I live in the United States.
I have to look for my pen.
We're shy.
I was kind of irritated.
Did you apologize to them?
They feared you.
He told me that he could do it.
There's a comma missing, otherwise it's fine.
You were very brave.
I have a sore throat. Do you have a cough drop?
He asked me if I was happy.
You have a lot of nerve.
I am learning Spanish.
Let's go to the pool.
What does your father do for a living?
I'm more famous.
Hawaii is an earthly paradise.
When do we begin?
Why did you hide?
You raise Arabian horses, don't you?
She shook my hand.
Tom can't come to the phone.
You're too tall.
This is their problem.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Tom told me I had to go home.
Do you like this?
The boy is big and strong.
I'm faster.
How did you find me?
How many crazy people are there in this town?

Tom knows what to do now.
Tom believes Mary was murdered.
I can understand him.
I wonder if Tom knows how wrong he is.
I'm exhausted.
I'll never be young again.
Isn't that good news?
Yesterday afternoon I wrote a letter.
You got what you deserved.
He rescued her.
She says she brushes her teeth every morning.
This question is one of great importance.
The guitar is in tune.
Here's what we know.
There are more Moslems than Christians in this town.
Tom moved to Australia last winter.
Where's my son?
My spoon is very large.
Watch Tom.
Don't forget to water the plants!
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I've let them down.
We're sorry we weren't able to help you.
Why is everybody looking at us?
Beijing is the capital of China.
Tom often forgets to lock the front door.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
I really do feel sorry for Tom.
Do you remember how much this cost?
Tom figured out how to solve the problem.
Why did she leave so suddenly?
Can I be of any service to you?
What color are they?
Where will you be on October 20th?
Do you understand what I want to say?
What time's your plane?
Don't you know how to do that?
Tom's disappointed.
The tram was crowded, so I decided to walk.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
Are you blind?
It isn't bad here.
Tell them you lied.
She fell off her chair.
Where is the kitchen?
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a child?
We have to wake up.
You're so nice.
I didn't think this would happen.
The problem is in that it's too expensive.
Though autumn gales are less clement than summer zephyrs, they are more exciting.
Tom has an immaculate sense of style.
There's a double standard.
Who is going to speak tonight?
Stop talking loudly.
Tom is at a meeting.
Let's decide together where to go first.
He stared at me.
You're very pessimistic.
We went downstairs to have breakfast.
You never should've promised to do that.
It's difficult to talk to Tom.
They earn their living by collecting and selling old newspapers.
I haven't told Tom yet.
Tom is in the living room, asleep on the sofa.
I have the video.
The bell rang, and the train began to move.
We all know that no one is perfect.
Do you have a pen?
Is it an illusion?
Is that what you want?
I had to go out for a while.
Tom started talking to himself.
How reliable is this information?
Tell them it's not my fault.
If the students are bored, they will find ways to entertain themselves.
Tom is very ambitious.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
We look forward to seeing you again.
Tom told me he was exhausted.
You don't need to know everything.
I made too many errors.
When did he go to Europe?
Connect the microphone.
This may be a trap.
I don't want to have a birthday party this year.
Let me say what I think.
I just want you to know that I won't be able to come to your picnic.
You've told me this story before tons of times.
This alone makes it worth living.
For understandable reasons, they have been rejected.
In a hole in the ground there lived a rabbit.
It's a very important thing.
I want to sit between you and Tom.
I need nappies for my baby.
Tom has three options.
We want to buy a house, but we need to save money for that.
Let Tom rest.
Are you going to kill her?
I've decided to forgive you.
Who here doesn't know how to do this?
There's only one egg left in the refrigerator.
All of my children like Boston.
Education is really important.
She hates carrots.
When did you buy that watch?
Never be afraid to make mistakes.
He actually didn't see the accident.
I'm glad you told me.
Tom stopped talking when he saw me.
He acts according to my advice.
Can I come in?
You're not serious.
Now it's neck or nothing!
I thought you knew her.
I don't think that this movie is interesting.
I looked at my reflection in the window.
You're not a veterinarian, are you?
I lived in poverty.
Why are you denying it?
Tom is sick, but he still went to work.
I can't go on like this.
We need to take her home.
I don't know where my umbrella is.
Let me invite you to dinner.
Don't tell me you stole it.
You're partially correct.
Tom paused a second.
Tom's coffee is good.
I'll call you again.
Think.
I think we should let Tom know that we'll be late.
You should never have come here.
I'll help you as much as I can.
John is much taller than Mary.
What'll you do if that happens?
He dumped me.
He's celebrating his name day.
I know how to tell a duck from a goose.
I asked him the same question.
You came back.
We don't like you.
You promised!
Is he your husband?
Tom makes a lot more money than Mary.
It's a portrait of my deceased father.
But they are all people.
I don't like working at the bank.
Tom and I've helped Mary a lot.
Tell me what to do here.
Tom is the only one who got hurt.
Safety is important.
I would really like to help you, but my hands are tied.
Tom stopped the car.
I'll give you a call when I get home.
One should try on shoes before purchasing them.
Ring the bell in an emergency.
Don't you dare talk to me like that.
I will give you a call tomorrow night.
Tom has decided to learn French.
I have lived here for a long time.
That doesn't make sense at all.
Tom died, but Mary didn't.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
Curiosity has landed inside the Gale crater.
Were you ready?
Can I ask you a personal question?
How much does your dog weigh?
Tom has a job interview on October 20th.
The ground seems wet.
They slept under the stars.
Have you ever tried to do that on your own?
We won three games.
Can you tell me where it is?
This is the most beautiful beach in the whole world.
What color will you paint the kitchen?
Tom knew that Mary kept a key under the doormat.
They all watched.
Fight for your dreams!
She's young, maybe too young.
Anybody can make a mistake.
They really did it.
Tom got into bed and turned off the light.
In all probability, we'll arrive before they do.
My mother made me a sweater.
What's the population of Australia?
Question as much as possible.
Everyone said that I was wrong.
Have you told Tom about what happened?
Tom clapped.
I'm trying to write a book.
This is a good start.
We heard her cry.
Shut that damn dog up.
I'm sure she will turn up soon.
Mary said she's not thirsty.
Do you want me to help him?
I think it's obvious.
Tom did it for money.
She must've forgotten her key.
Please tell me where to go next.

I don't like either of the pictures.
I want something sweet.
Tell him everything I told you.
Tom became an officer.
What's the last thing you remember?
When I snap my fingers, you'll wake up.
Don't get in my way.
I can't explain.
I may know him.
Was Tom angry?
I wouldn't want you to think I was crazy.
"Is that an illegal taxi?", I asked him.
We'll get married in October.
Are you dead?
I don't think Tom knows the details.
Tom has lost his car keys.
I am married and have two children.
No one seems to know the answer.
That's a yikes from me, sweaty.
Does anyone know how Tom got in?
He's a bad influence on her.
I'll go by plane.
Tom doesn't know what happened yesterday.
At least we know Tom is alive.
This flower gives off a strong fragrance.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
I can't allow that.
You're going to have to work with Tom.
That's true.
You know why I left.
Take him to the station.
He liked her.
When I explained to the squirrels that for me this task was like a nut that needed to be cracked, they understood why I was working on it so diligently.
I hope it doesn't rain this Sunday.
If you need us, we'll be here.
We have almost no water left.
Tom's eyes twinkle with amusement.
I want to be there.
Do you eat meat every day?
I thought you'd already made a decision.
Pirates never drink water.
He's started writing a novel.
Do you know Tom's father?
In Greece, I speak Greek.
Tom had no idea that I'd be here.
How much money does Tom make a month?
Are you lucky?
Don't give him any of that soup.
Nothing but your love can save her now.
Why did you marry her?
Close the door before going to bed.
I met her only once.
This avenue is wide but not very long.
Tom wanted to find out where Mary lived.

It's cold in Boston in the winter.
India is the seventh largest country in the world.

You were an honest politician.
To be honest, I'm not so sure either.
I need a leather folder.
Tom folded his T-shirt carefully.
Tom doesn't know you were here.
You need a shave.
Turn it off, Tom.
I'm the owner of this land.
I do not like science.
I don't think that Tom could've done that.
He got sick during the trip.
I want to go with them.
The news soon spread all over the village.
I come from Brazil.
He did that on purpose.
You'd be stupid to trust him.
Why is Tom being so generous?
Mary doesn't wear as much makeup as Alice.
Tom will leave Boston tomorrow morning.
We're telling the truth.
Mary was desperately in love with Tom.
Your answer is wrong.
Tom pretended that he didn't recognize Mary.
There are few such people.
Have you been there yet?
Follow your dreams, they know the way.
Try to be on time tomorrow.
I dreamed I was eating an apple pie.
We shouldn't expect too much.
Kids want to play.
I'm afraid you can't go there.
How many centimeters are there in a meter?
During his administration a great many new laws were passed.
If Tom had more time, he could do that.
If you are happy, I am happy.
Everyone wanted to talk to Tom.
I know I shouldn't care what Tom thinks.
It was a brief journey.
You know what?
Do you remember how much it cost?
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
I know someone who has never seen the ocean.
He said he'd go there tomorrow.
The refrigerator is dirty.
I wonder what could have made him change his mind.
I'm kind of surprised.
Were you forced to do that?
Tom dressed up as a pirate.
Tom needs to say something.
I think that she is from France.
He failed the exam because he's lazy.
We shouldn't have told them.
The rescuers pulled out the young girl from the avalanche.
Do you have your driver's license?
A lot of people were killed in World War II.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
I thought about smashing his guitar, but I didn't do it.
It wasn't as easy to do that as I thought it would be.
Tom needed rest.
She looks young, but in reality she's over 40.
Tom knew I loved Mary.
Tom said nothing at all.
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.
A beard doesn't make a philosopher, nor does wearing a cheap coat.
He planned the attack carefully.
I'd love to have breakfast with you.
Now and then she plays tennis.
Pass me that hammer.
You're the only person I've told.
The two statements don't agree.
It's because you're an idiot.
As for the Emperor, he is the ruler of the world. As for the barbarians, they are the servants of the world.
You'd better be more careful.
I'm studying French because I need it for my job.
I don't even know you.
You have no authority to do that.
This guitar belongs to me.
I need to concentrate.
This dog barks at everyone it doesn't know.
Tom is hard up for money.
I forgot my briefcase.
Tom comes from a small town.
I think it'll be easy.

Tom doesn't know how he's going to do that yet.
Tom knew all that.
Tom said Mary was lonely.
I thought you were smart.
I'll buy it.

Where's the men's room? I want to wash my hands.
I'm going to go home.
I saw you with her.
Which browser do you use?
We've got to try it.
Tom had to wait for Mary for about three hours.
I'm afraid it's too late.
I'm expecting a call from Tom.
How's the weather there?
I want to know where Tom is.
You may speak freely.
You can eat the rest of the cake, if you want.
She will pay 50 dollars at most.
I didn't call Tom.
Do you like cats or dogs better?
Follow this road till you come to the river.
He says he has other priorities.
Do you really believe there's a connection?
Why are you so insecure?
What's the admission fee?
Has Tom returned?
Do you really think this is going to work?
I'll see you at lunch tomorrow.
We'll wait for your return.
Tom lost the bet.
How many more are there?
Recently I've only been watching The Simpsons.
I thought Tom was hungry.
What's up, everybody?
I know everybody here.
She may have missed her bus.
Why do you learn English?
You're running out of time.
It's Tom's turn to wash the dishes.
I hope she's all right.
Mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
I thought it'd be worth it.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
It was disgusting.
That's my medicine.
I said nothing, which made her angry.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I have high hopes for him.
At the present time, Tom is in Boston.
My dog is bigger than yours.
Drive cautiously.
Can you read this?
I'm curious about something.
The old rules don't apply.
I hope you are hungry.
Can you read these sentences?

I saw you in the park with her.
I remembered everybody.
The police looked everywhere and couldn't find any trace of Tom.
Bill is a baseball player.
I slept like a log.
Don't tell your mother.
Tom respected Mary.
This is a crime against humanity.
Now get out of my room.
Don't ever say her name.
He was sleeping under the tree.
You're hard to please.
You can make your own.
The word's origin is unclear.
Don't be a stranger.
Tom will be getting home soon.
There was food enough for us all.
Is the baby OK?
You're quite attractive.
I totally agree with you both.
Patient people always win.
Look what we've found.
These are completely different opinions.
I didn't know your uncle lived with you.
I think Tom heard me.
There was no point in arguing with him at this point.
The rich are not always happier than the poor.

Just tell Tom I called.
Let's have a go at it.

Tom closed his eyes for a second.
I think you've overcooked the broccoli.
Turn on the radio, please.
You're cute.
Tom works with us.
I'm glad to hear it!
Where are my parents?
I could have saved Tom's life.
Find out what they said.
What happened to them?

No one had a clue who I was.
Did he tell you?
They had lived there until they came to Tokyo.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
I'm early again.

That tree looks dead.
She always gets up early.
He cannot have said so.
I thought she was my friend.
Go somewhere else.
I think Tom has left.
Tom and Mary were busy.
I know you were giving Tom money.

You're not paying attention!
He was right after all.
What's the urgency?

We are busy people.
I sometimes see him on the street.
What's the problem, Tom?

She showed her guests how to eat what she had prepared.
Did you want to meet with Tom?
I know who your father is.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
Some would say that he's playing with fire.
Tom won't likely be interested.
Tom must've been sick.
You could do that if you really wanted to.
I've never been to Paris.
I'll have to warn Tom.
Let's not deceive ourselves.
I know a lot of people who don't have driver's licenses.
I've fallen in love with somebody else.
It would cost twice as much as that.
Open your mouth.
Do you know how to ride a bike?
Write it in pencil.

Our cat is in the kitchen.
I'm writing a novel.
It's not my cup of tea.
I'll call on you on Monday.
I've never liked her.
I have my own theory.
Can you wait until I make up my face?
Which direction are you going?
Have you subscribed to any newspapers or journals?
Do you like carrots?
Is that you?
We have collected only ripe fruit.
They are talking about this and that.
You're no doctor.
What is the size of the universe?
Tell her we don't want to go.
Tom told me he's never done that.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
I think Tom has already done that.
The guests won't arrive for an hour. In the meantime, we can set the table.
I need subtitles.
It is clear that he pretended to be ill.
Perhaps you're right.
Did you speak with them?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
The girl was trembling with fear.
Which one of those is yours?

Mary is quick at repartee.
How much time did it take to do that?
Please send us more information.
She may be in danger.
Let them come in.
Tom is the enemy.
My husband didn't die.
Tom is nodding his head.
I'm not sure if I have the courage to ask for her number.
No wonder he refused your offer.
That isn't the best answer.
We were waiting for you.
Did you get lost?
Where did you get the idea?
The exam was real hard.
Tom doesn't come here as often as he used to.
I am going to write a letter tomorrow.
Just tell her what you want.
The men loaded the baggage into the truck.
Hey, wake up!
I'm not a bad person.

Before you leave, can I ask you something?
What gave them that idea?
It is quite a common expression.
Ask them yourself.
They granted his request.
We'll get through this together.
I'll handle this.
What's your home address?
Tom speaks with a southern accent.
She greeted him waving her hand.
Tom sees it a little differently.
Aren't you going to help?
The hospital quarantined the infected patients to avoid cross infection.
It's started to snow.
Could I have some more tea?
Tom said he's healthy.
I've never seen so many people in one place.
I'm going to give it a try.
Everyone left, except for us.
The wound was bleeding heavily.
I sold it for ten dollars.
We hope you'll join us.

Tom opposed the plan.
You're braver than me.
Is it true that Tom tried to drown himself?
If I were you, I wouldn't think two times, but three times!

We're illiterate.
We have a lot of problems to deal with.
The books that you're looking for are on my desk.
Tom burned a wad of bills.
Nobody sang with me.
How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
I'm sorry about what's happened.
I think that Tom is right.
I can't visit you every day.
Could Tom have done this?
Watch your step. The floor is slippery.
I put it back.
Tom would never do such a thing.
I'm scared of myself, because I know myself.
You can’t teach a pike how to swim.
Did you really steal this food?
Now try to sleep.
I spoke to Tom last night and he told me that he likes you.
She'll do that only if she has to.
I haven't been following the news lately.
Ask your question.
She translated that word for word.
You are in a safe place.
I'll call on you on Sunday.
You'll fall down.
I know where you went last weekend.

Please feed the cat.
Oh, by the way, I have something to show you.
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Are you going to eat this?
I wanted to thank you for last night.
I must speak to her.
Why did you tell them I'd left?
What a splendid idea!
I thought I could trust them.
He started washing his car.
Tom has advised Mary not to do that.
I've always hated Tom.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Did you know Tom had a son?
She tried to save him.
Nice to meet you.
I have a wonderful job.
I like classical music more than modern music.
Is 2:30 too late?
You may eat now.
Stop poking around here.
Maybe you were wrong.
What makes you think Tom hates you?
You're Czech, aren't you?
He tried, in vain, to borrow a large sum of money from them.
You'll be mine.
I'm not accusing anyone.
I don't want to marry you.
Peel the apples or wash them.
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
I shook my head.
Tom gave a lot of money to Mary.
Here is our guarantee.
Do you think Tom is sick?
I promise not to disappoint you.
Did you order this?

We're Tom's family.
He lost his temper and shouted at me.
I think that's Tom over there.
Tell me more about yourselves.
He did what you asked him to do.
We've decided to stay for a few more days.
My name is not "Mr. Ricardo"; it's just Ricardo or Rick.
We're in danger.
Tom has already begun.
I just emailed you.
It's complicated, isn't it?
They stayed away from the place.
We just want to help them.
Where did you spend your vacation?
There are dumb people like Dan everywhere.
You shouldn't have let this happen.
Did she tell them the truth?
I can't wait to tell them.
Your friend is very lucky.
Tom can help you as well.
I called Tom a cab.
She met a new friend at school today.
Who's Tom swimming with?
I was the only one who didn't fall into the trap.
The battery gave out.
This will continue.
You must get going.
I don't think that Tom is busy now.
How about a cup of tea?
He counted to one hundred.
No one wanted to talk about it.
That was unavoidable.
I gave the boy a book.
I'm sure you'll understand.
Now drink up.
If you want to leave, leave.
Did you pass the test?
My mother made me a white dress.
He claims that you stole them.
I regard myself as your guardian.
We can talk for hours and it never gets dull.
I've brought you a cup of coffee.
They must be dead.
Cut back on sugar.
I am not racist.
I'm getting tired of you.
Tom gave Mary one of his guitars.
That would be suicidal.
I know that I'll be punished.
I just want to know why you left so early.
You should try this.
He was second.
It was a joint decision.
Nobody in their right mind would do that.
I'm on Tom's side.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
The tower is three hundred and twenty-one meters high.
These three countries were united into one.
Can I give you this?
I don't think anybody would do that.
I hear there was an earthquake in Shizuoka.
Let me carry your bag.
I have to let you go.
We can deliver within a week.
Sometimes I say "yes," even though I want to say "no."
We want a peaceful solution.
Tom couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him.
A back massage relaxes the muscles.
You have grains of rice stuck around your mouth.
I'm sure she will become a great singer.
When it comes to politics, I know nothing.
She never existed.
Fill the bucket with water.
I've got the money.
I love you more than anyone else.
An army is a nation within a nation; it is one of the vices of our age.
He announced the next singer.
He cheated on the biology exam.
It is said that Tokyo is a very safe city.
Tom did twenty pushups.
Don't expect Tom to win.
Tom said that Mary was jealous.
You missed the point entirely.
Ann is a little girl.
I asked Tom where he got that.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
I don't want to be forgotten.
I might've done the same thing.
My mother hates watching the television.
The man puffed smoke into her face.
If it isn't expensive, I'll buy it.
The great politician passed away in 1963.
I'd like to invite you to dinner.
Tom believed them.
Get me some ice.
These people live in unsanitary conditions.
I told Tom the truth about us.
Get out of here.
Tom asked a few questions.
How was your biology exam?
I've finally gotten used to living here.
Tom has probably already left.
Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise.
Ask her to help you.
Where will you be tomorrow?
She likes me more than she likes you.
Is it true that you bought a house in London?
I hope Tom recovers quickly.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
About thirty people attended Tom's funeral.
You killed my father.
Tom asked Mary to speak to you about that.
The situation seems hopeless.
Nobody likes me.
Why don't we go find Tom?
You were just lucky.
He ran so fast that he was out of breath.
"Where is your father now?" "I believe he is in Lyons."
I would like to go, but I don't have a car.
He completed his mission very successfully.
The children are pretending to brush their teeth.
The summer vacation is over.
Would you like to stay for lunch?
It was in Kyoto that I first met her.
Tom is the only one in our family who doesn't like singing.
The streets are filled with an air of exoticism.
Smiling cheerfully, the two began to walk off into their brilliant future.
Tom painted a good portrait of his mother.
By then it will already be too late.
You can watch television after dinner.
I didn't want you to tell him the truth.
Does Tom know who did that?
The more people have, the more they want.
How are you going to tell them?
Tom couldn't find an empty parking space.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
I wasn't sure whether Tom was joking or not.
She's not my grandmother. She's my mother.
I always knew that you could do that.
You're polite.
What more can you show me?
Keep off the religious issue when talking with him.
Tom never told me he didn't like Mary.
What is it really about?
Many promises had been made.
Mary told me she'd be here about 2:30.
Tom acted as if nothing had happened.
He's complex.
Tom wasn't in the car.
Please help yourself to the pizza.
I bought a pair of sunglasses for Tom.
The coat looks good on you.
Help me, please.
Tom traveled first class.
I wanted to speak in French with Tom.
Aren't you from the consulate?
He broke both his legs.
Where do we register?
Tom relaxed a bit.
I think I scared Tom.
Smoking is prohibited here.
If it rains tomorrow, we will go there by car.
Tom says he can trace his ancestors back about 300 years.
Why is there sawdust on the floor?
So don't hesitate.
I was in a plane crash.
Tom said he wasn't from Boston.
Tom is the one who doesn't understand.
Tom doesn't like me.
You're probably tired.
Tell them to leave.
I accidentally the whole Coke bottle; is that bad?
This movie is suitable for children.
Didn't Tom tell you we'd be late?
Tom is walking his dogs.
Do you pluck your eyebrows?
I made tea.
Call off your dogs.
Let them do this.
You are a man, but you act like a child.
The gnarled branches scraped and grasped for me like living hands.
And Mary was buried in the rural graveyard, under the shadow of the belfry tower.
Were you listening?
We don't have time to look for that right now.
She is dressed in white.
Drive cautiously.
Tomorrow is a long-awaited payday!
Tom is the only one who can handle this.
It's their fault.
I don't know much about linguistics.
I want a bed next to the window.
Tom heard Mary talking to herself.
The first person is here.
I think Tom would agree with me.
You really exaggerate returning at this time.
Is Tom busy?
Tanaka plays the piano well.
He underwent a risky operation.
Please return the book by tomorrow.
Tom asked me to leave.
It's important to us.
Does Tom have a pass?
Tom didn't work as hard as Mary did.
It sounds strange, but it's true.
Do I know them?
She decided to sell her car.
Come on!
When was the last time you slept in this room?
There are also some children who don't like apples.
I'll call her and apologize.
I don't really agree with that.
You can have half of this.
Do you miss him?
Tom will have a busy weekend.
I can buy what I need on my way home.
"Didn't you get married!?" "Oh, we split up. We broke our engagement."
If I don't help you, who will?
She is dear to me.
He is going to go to school tomorrow.
I went out with Mary.
We didn't steal it! We won it fair and square!
I made many mistakes.
Did you buy milk?
I found this at the risk of my life.
Who illustrated this book?
You were seventh.
I often have ear infections.
Tom hasn't told us his opinion yet.
Are you sure it's all true?
I haven't done that in a long time.
Tom didn't notice me.
May I ask you some questions?
I heard you got married.
The school's principal is on the second floor.
Please tell them to hurry up.
I have difficulty breathing.
It is pretty cold today.
We can't leave you here.
They looked at each other and smiled.
He's a very good friend.
Tom is a skilled player.
I'm not sure that that'll happen.
Tom is one of Boston's most successful lawyers.
I speak Chinese almost every day.
I knew how you'd react.
You are wrong. That is not what I said.

I lived in a three-room apartment when I lived in Boston.
I knew that I'd break her heart, but I had no choice.
Don't you want to have another son?
There's a hole in my coat.
They lost their property.
I'm closer to Tom than anyone.
What time should I call you?
It's sad to see Tom so unhappy.
I go to school with Tom.
We kept in touch.
My brother is a doctor.
Just find Tom.
Can't we fire her?
I could tell by the look on Tom's face that he knew what was going on.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
Tom has three young children.
We have to be there by 2:30.
She put her head out of the window.
Have you seen my wife? Have you seen Mary?
We played better.
Tom heard the car coming back.
I just want to know if Tom is all right.
Stop! You're making him cry.
I am in the house.
I have a mole on my cheek.
It's quite pleasant.
Does your mother know about this?
Tom asked Mary to take off her shoes before she entered his house.
It was quite dark when I got there.
Tell her that I am watching the news.
I didn't understand it.
Travelling is one of the saddest pleasures of life.
Talk to me.
Will you come to Brazil?
Young girls really want to be slender.
You shouldn't trust that man.

Have you ever read the Constitution of Japan?
Can you take a little break?
I'm talking to him right now.
Tom tried to stop the bleeding.

Every day grandfather and grandmother gave the kitten plenty of milk, and soon the kitten grew nice and plump.
I've been doing this longer than you.
Not on my desk!
He is as old as I.
Tom tried to compose himself.
I had a little help.
Let me explain to you how this works.
We stood face to face with death.
I'd rather die than marry you.
And now, where is my pen?
Are you taking any medicine?
We have no time.
Did Tom see us?
I don't have to know.
My neck hurts today.
He says he isn't worried.
Tom did nothing but cry.
I know that you stole it.
Are you seeing someone else?
Tom's palms became sweaty.
Tom has gotten married.
I wrote a letter in English.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
Do you know what you're doing?
I'd like you to do something.
I felt the wind blowing on my face.
You're obviously upset.
Where can we park?
They went to a bar.
Tom will never agree.
Tom is going to meet Mary today.
My mother isn't like other mothers.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
This is a good bargain.
Did you get Tom something?
Have patience with me.
He scolded her.
Ouch! My foot!
I should've paid more attention.
Armenia joined the World Trade Organization in 2003.
Do I have to go?
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
Let's be honest with each other.
Tom and Mary said they didn't have any plans for next weekend.
The sayings of Confucius are famous.
You're going to like working for me.

Do you help your wife at home?
What do you want to give her?
I didn't start all this.
I told Tom myself.
Do you have an answer?
I was confused.
She made friends with them at the school festival.
Do you have a superhero costume?
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
I will make him pay the money.
You should emphasize that fact.
No one knew who Tom was.
I don't need them anymore.
Will you go to Boston with me?
I can't see you due to the press of business.
Don't do that.
I immediately accepted his offer.
I didn't know what to do until Tom told me.
I learnt it from him.
He turned a somersault.
You didn't trust me.
You need to have a serious conversation with him about this.
I can't find a single flaw in his theory.
Ziri didn't even think about that.
I don't think that Tom is a loser.
Summer isn't over yet!
I was born on a farm.
Where is the entrance?
Tom left Boston three months ago.
I noticed you weren't at home last night.
I suspect Tom doesn't want to do that anymore.
He's making progress.
Tom thinks Mary is busy.
This ticket is valid for three days.
I'll get rid of it.
Tom is younger than Mary.
Tom didn't believe that.
He is busy preparing for an examination.
Who do you want to go to Boston with?
I'm very shy.
I won't leave you again.
They were arguing.
We've talked about it.
I've never had such a large sum of money.
We recognized it from your description.
Please tell me where the bus stop is.
Can you help me to translate these sentences into Chinese?
Do you think Tom would help Mary do that?
Did you hear a voice in the next room?
Our delay was due to traffic congestion.
Would you mind leaving the room?
I'm worried about my weight.
Don't forget to think before you speak.

I wasn't sure you'd like that.
Tom wants to talk.
They help each other.

You can't enter; it's forbidden.
Tom is sure that everyone saw him.
Tom worked indoors.
He discovered a new star.
That's a myth.
Tom isn't dead.
I want him to live.
Tom didn't make any comment on that.
Does that hurt?
German cars are among the best.
They won't let this pass.
I'm just trying to be neighborly.
I've tried to be reasonable.
I want you to help.
It's very onerous.
We haven't yet decided what to do with it.
Tom and Mary don't know who's living in the house next to theirs.
Call your sisters.
Tom comes here every other month.
Show me where the pain is.
What's your debt?
Tom put on his sunglasses.
He showed me his new car.
I've never needed anybody.
I've never heard Tom sing.
I don't think Tom did it.
Tom cleared snow from the driveway.
Are you cold?
I just don't think I can do that.
Something always happens.
Carmen is a Spanish name.
I left a message.
Today is not your day.
Breathe in, breathe out.
I want you to like them.
The climate here is milder than that of Moscow.
Tom laughed like a madman.
Why should I lend you any money?
Call me if you find something.
I noted that her answer was incorrect.
As soon as Tom saw the police car, he started running.
I'm trying to prove Tom's innocence.
Who is looking after the dog while you are away?
Ask an expert.
My name is Mary, what's yours?
Allow me to explain.
Thank you for inviting me here.
I wasn't thinking.
Tell me you love me.
You and I are about the same height.
Tom picked up a good bargain yesterday.
Whip him until he confesses.
I've already told you that I don't know what to do.
I decided not to do it.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Boston.
We are happy to have you join our team.
You're our neighbor.
He got a good grade in mathematics.
Why did I do this?
Listen while I talk.
He got out his pen.
Where are they?
I was having lunch.
Do you think that you should always tell the truth?
I'm more interested in spoken French.
I am learning that the world consists only of quantum relations. Matter, space, time do not exist.
This is hard for you, isn't it?
I was just pretending I was rich.
I went fishing with them.
The giraffe didn't see the lioness.
Please keep the door open.
Give me that other box.
Is Tom bluffing?
I think you'd better take a rest; you look ill.
Did they suffer?
I never liked you.
I'm still not sure I can help you.
I didn't need your help.
You sound like her.
Tom said that he didn't want me to worry.
What are you going to do this evening?
The cat is trying to climb the tree.
You look a little green around the gills.
You can ask Tom about that.
Don't think about the past.
Do you have a garage?
I helped a lot.
I don't like to be ignored.
Health begins with good sleep.
We were unable to follow his logic.
Tom had one brother and three sisters.
I will be at the same place as always.
I thought you were taller.
Tom told me he was going to kill you.
He can read and write.
Sit down, please.
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
Are you free now?
I know now that Tom was mistaken.
You need to get some sleep.

Do you think I'm fat?
No good deed goes unpunished.

I don't understand how the human brain works.
He has a good reputation.
Tom wants you to hear this.
That's possible.

Do you have a mobile phone?
He is going to destroy the economy.
I think she's too young.
Try not to fall asleep.
Italy is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea.
She pushed him out the window.

It's the perfect number.
After waiting all day, the workers were still looking for a break in the weather so they could resume the search.
I still don't trust you.
Look after your little sister.
I want to learn how to program.
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
How much fabric did you buy?
I can hide anywhere.
I can show you the pictures.
Why don't you let him decide?
I was filled with joy.
Walking to work in this heat is a bad idea.
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
Tom became very irate.
It seems like just yesterday that you were here.
I hope you find him.
"May I borrow your dictionary?" "Of course."
I got Tom to help.
Nobody was listening to what Tom was saying.
I understand you well.
Does Tom want me to call back?
I say what I think.
Tom rarely goes out after dark.
All my friends have one.
I'll leave it up to you.
Mary has huge tits.
Do you work with them?

Tom is trying to stop Mary.
I hope someday we'll find life beyond Earth.
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
That's pointless.
Let me tell you about Tom.
Tom waited in his car across the street from the bank.
This happens from time to time.
He says he isn't tired yet.
Who else was there?
We'll help you look for her.
What size do you take?
The new waiter should be much more competent.
No matter who comes, don't open the door.
Tom tried to win Mary's heart.
I hope it's useful.
She's a self-made woman.
I'm very disappointed in both of you.
I know you stole it.
Mine is bigger than yours.
We missed you, too.
I should be in Boston.
You've got a pretty good memory.
Cancel culture has become today's Inquisition.
We study Arabic.

Are you really alone?
I hope we get paid extra for doing that.
You should keep in touch with Mr. Smith.
I'm mulatto.
I've put on weight recently.
I was tempted.
I'm immune.
Nothing will happen to me.
One man one word. One woman one dictionary.
I think I could fix that.
We had a very long talk.
Don't leave town.
Does Tom like his job?
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
He was overwhelmed by the intensity of her love.
Do you want me to tell them?
He dedicated his life to medical work.
A woman like you doesn't deserve a man like me.

He's ten years older than you.
None of them said anything.
Don't touch this!
Tom seemed to be in some pain.
Tom is calculating his salary.
I think that guy looks like Tom.
You should come back immediately.
I think she hates me.
Tom's not ready for that.
Sit up straight.
Let's play outside.
He cut the apple in two.
He walks slowly.
She left for America the day before yesterday.
She knows that she's dying.
You forgot something.
What movie do you want to see?
Everyone wanted to dance.
I told Mary she's crazy.
That shirt is too large for you.
Yes, you need to practice every day.
Tom is allergic to strawberries.
What else do you know about Tom?
Tom and Mary are almost done.
They need your help.
Is there anything else?
I bet it was him who did it.
I'll never forgive Tom.
What were you doing before this?
The drivers are at the starting line and raring to go!

Were you looking at her?
I remember the warmth of her arms.
We discussed our plans for the summer holidays.
You must rest.

If he's proficient in English, I'll hire him.
I can't sing as well as you can.
I won't be here long.
I'm a reporter.
I have a lot of questions.
I could feel nothing but the knife as it plunged into my back.
Tom said that he wouldn't help anybody.
I'm leaving in the afternoon.
Would you excuse us?
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Why didn't you ask Tom to help?
Tom refused to carry Mary's suitcase.
When she said "I missed you" she began to cry.
I don't think that I heard you correctly.
This should be done immediately.
Was Tom the one who gave you this squirt gun?
Do you want me to help them?
I'm not very young.
Please, open your mouth!
Do you want to talk to her?
Tom is the only one here that I know.

Where can I buy one of those?
This I know from my own experience.
Are you fucking stupid?
I think you were wrong.
I talked to the waiter in French.
Their swords clashed.
Tom noticed that Mary was smiling.
Something's wrong here.
He is the boy of whom I spoke the other day.
I'm unlikely to ever do that again.
Did you tell Tom what to buy?
I'll agree to your terms.
I will return the book as soon as I can.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
You will soon get used to the change of climate.
Have a good time on your date.
I lost a lot of blood.
In foreign countries, especially in Western countries, students are encouraged to express and develop themselves as individuals.
In Paris they simply stared when I spoke to them in French; I never did succeed in making those idiots understand their own language.

I don't know what it's like yet.
Do you have any siblings?
Will you help?

I laughed at his joke.
Do you believe him?
I am okay.
I didn't want Tom to win.
How much milk do you want?
We'll go wash ourselves in the river tomorrow.
The fewer who know about it, the better.
What's that boy's name?
Tom has been busy since this morning.
I'm doing this to help her.
Where did he get that sweater?
I won't get vaccinated.
I have to go to bed.
Well!
Tom didn't beat around the bush.
A ball hit her on the right leg.
He asked me to lend him my pencil.
When did I do that?
I don't like to sing sad songs.
I can see a ship in the distance.
We didn't notice.
It hurts when I touch it.
I didn't follow instructions.
Tell Tom I feel fine.
Did they tell you who I was?
I wanted to win.
Don't talk to Tom.
Get straight to the point.
We've discussed this many times already.
Tom didn't agree to the proposal.
I wasn't waiting for you.
Please go with Tom.
Count from one to a hundred.
No matter how much effort I make, people always find mistakes in my actions.
I filled both glasses with wine.
I have several good friends.
I think about that a lot.
You could've asked me.
She pretended she didn't know him.
Can I ask you for a favor?
Keep out.
Tom almost pushed the wrong button.
We may be in danger.
Mary says she isn't sick.
Tom will never know.

Tom was as pale as a sheet.
I want to talk to him alone.

I don't like to use Google Translate.
Pay close attention to the details.

I can't do that job.
Canada is a large country.
Mary kissed a boy for the first time.
Buy me the red one.
In the darkness, she could hear him and his guests chatting and laughing.
I know what you think of me.
This parcel is addressed to you.
I am going to Hokkaido in the summer.
Is this bag yours or his?
It's just ten degrees, and he is walking around outside in a T-shirt. I get cold from just looking at him.
Does Tom want a dog?
I don't believe you!
We did not get your letter until yesterday.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I feel tired.
I'm not bald.
Thank Tom for me.
I knew Tom was a busy man.
I would never kill myself.
I share your opinion.
Please tell me where you will live.

All of my friends like them.
I want you fired.
I wish you hadn't told me.
This novel is too difficult for me to read.
I didn't know.
Tom put the bird back in its cage.
Sign here and here, please.

Meanwhile, I want ice cream.

At what time did you arrive at your home?
I need to get there soon by any means.
Tom unzipped the zip file.
Give me a hug.
Tom drank a whole bottle of wine.
It's true that she knows a lot about cooking, but she isn't a good cook.
Tom told me he was drunk.

Very few people aren't afraid of death.
Tom and Mary fought like cat and dog.
Does he live here?
Tom can't live without Mary.
They're very pretty.

That's not important to me.
I bought you a present.
Would you mind if I asked you a question?
Where can I park the car?
Tom probably knows the answer.
I still haven't forgiven Tom.
How long have you known about it?
They angered me.
When will he give it to you?
I'll tell him that.
Duping Mary should be easy as a piece of cake.
I improvised.
When did you go to Boston?
Tom said something to Mary.

The dog followed me to my home.
I thought you said you worked here.
What're you doing?
I wanted you to see me.
Get out of here!
We shouldn't have let him go.
How would you handle this problem?
It wasn't a coincidence.
I am having a nap.
Tom ordered a cup of coffee for himself and a cup of cocoa for Mary.

While Pseudo and Co. wage their war on the new site, I've been happily posting here, and reaping a few green orbs for it. During the times that I didn't get green orbs, for example on short comments that I never wanted to get rated anyway, I chose to stay quiet about it not because I want to show that I'm emotionally strong, or being the bigger man or anything. Of course I get upset about it. I like green! Their cyan-and-lower ratings not only bring down my average, but also look ugly on my green-themed posts. Basically, it rustles my jimmies by more than a little bit. Before, as some of you know, I might have started to complain about I don't want my comments to get rated when it's something trivial. Yet I choose not to reply because I know that what I have to say will likely be met with hostility, based on my experience with Fig Hunters.

I started running.
Let's delay this decision until tomorrow.
Don't drink too much.
I hope Tom wins.
Mary looked in her purse.
Tom was afraid of you.
What you're asking us to do is impossible.
She's a frequent visitor to this country.
This is what scares them.
Tom told everyone to sit down.
I doubt you can do that.
Tom thought he was losing his mind.
Is this the best you can do?
My eyes feel gritty.

Tell her to help us.
He will come afterwards.
He was a rare example of an honest politician.
Why are you asking me this?
Tom didn't like it, but he still bought it.
It was found at the bottom of the river.

Pay no attention to it.
Tom was a little surprised by how well Mary could sing.

What time did that happen?
I'll have to deal with that on my own.
You should be a writer.
You're very independent.

There is a large house on the hill.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
We looked up.

It's just a tale.
That's no way to talk to a child.
You're not invited.
Bunnies are very cute.
Tom wasn't very busy today.

Pitch the ball.
Would Tom do that?
I cannot excuse her.
There are animals here.

Tom has a suitcase full of money.
It's new.
We don't have much choice.
What have you seen?

Don't be afraid, I'm here.
This used to be my room.
I'm going away for a few days.

You should've apologized to Tom for calling him names.
The more I sleep, the less I feel like working.
I can hardly believe that.
Why don't you go with her?

Gulls flew over the sea.
I have to go to Boston.
I always pray for world peace.

I can read Chinese fairly well, but I can't write it very well.
Tom never talks about that.
Tom is exaggerating, I think.
Where's your proof?
Tom was not alone.

This happened in autumn. Light gray clouds covered the sky.
You're Czech, aren't you?
This is a big mistake.
Tom and Mary hated one another.
Are you happy with that?
Tom thinks Mary can't understand French.
We all know you're smart.
Why don't you wait till tomorrow?
You didn't tell him, did you?
Let me tell you about the case.
Tom went back into the kitchen.
Tom talked in his sleep.
When does it begin?
Do you mind if I take this?
Germany was once an ally of Italy.
Don't look through the keyhole.
I sent Tom the link to your website.
There will be no lessons from now on.
He founded the school five years ago.
I doubt you'll be able to do that.
I know that you can't play the guitar.
I lost my wallet.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
He sits at his computer all day.
She has forgiven him for everything.
We talked with the owner of the house.
Give me the pen.
I forgot the guidebook at the hotel.
What'll you do next?
I don't have a guitar.
Did you hear that, too?
Mary discovered that Tom was secretly a talented singer.
Are you sure it was Tom who did this?
He will always be with you.
The more I read, the less I know.
He was painfully thin.
I'm getting out of the hospital tomorrow.
I didn't know a thing about it.
I knew Tom wouldn't help Mary.
What should I feed my dog?
Tom can leave early if he wants to.
I will tell your father everything.
Tell Tom to do this.
I know a lot of people.
Does it hurt?
Could you go to the store for me?
I told you to stay in the room.
Rub two sticks together to get the fire started.
I'll see you soon, OK?
I shouldn't have asked you to sing.
Tom never saw his father again.
I knew that it wasn't yours.
Tom said Mary is very happy here.
It's probably just a myth that Isaac Newton discovered the laws of gravity when an apple fell on his head while he was sitting under a tree.
Look at that red car.
I've never gotten on a plane yet.
Why don't you trust Tom?
Tom is watching.
Everybody loves Lego.
What did you tell her for?
I've got to stay a little longer.
That's not for you to decide.
I cannot meet him out. It's raining.
You're going to tell Tom what happened, aren't you?
She isn't running.
I don't think that Tom's story is true.
The bus stopped and we got on.
I don't see much of her.
Tom grabbed Mary by the throat and choked her.
You're the only person that I can trust.
Tom left without me.
I'm with Tom.
Here's a list of things for you to do while I'm gone.
Do you remember what he was wearing?
I sleep in the attic.
What were you talking to Tom about?
Didn't you notice that?
Everything I undertake goes wrong.
I'd advise waiting until at least Monday.
Did you tell him you were joking?
We've already achieved that.
Wash your hands before you eat.
Tom looked tired.
I'm wiping the table.
This tree was planted by my grandfather.
We weren't even in Australia at that time.
Don't you dare cry!
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary parked her car.
I wanted to talk about it.
Their house is yellow.
My life's an open book.
Tom made thirty thousand dollars last month.
Why am I shooting these guys, tell me, what have they done?
A guard is outside.
My watch is two minutes fast.
I don't think that I'll be able to convince Tom to do that.
I can't give it to you.
That coat is too small for you.
Ask me something easier.
I have children.
I always keep three dictionaries at hand.
I didn't think you would win the race.
This is a handy little box.
I didn't hear her coming.
I wanted you to feel at home.
I didn't get anything for my birthday.
I was surprised to see that happen.
Why hasn't anybody ever told me about it?
The font is too large.
I'll give her another chance.
This isn't the way to Tom's house.
I am always ready to help you.
How could you say such a thing?
Scoot over and make room for Tom.
He grew up in Germany.
I will ask you five questions.
Tom and Mary just celebrated their silver anniversary.
You lost.
It's obvious Tom wants to do that.
Tom has sore toes.
Nevertheless, she took off her coat and seemed ready for a short conversation.
Tom bent over to pick up a coin that was on the floor.
I wanted you to win.
They're coming.
We will stay at home rather than get there so late.
What kind of tree is this?
You could talk to her.
Tell her that.
You're my friends.
Aren't you Sami?
Ready!
We were happy.
What did they feel?
She was eager to feed the birds.
When's Tom arriving?
Who told you the story?
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
Ah, I have been here before!
Yesterday we were biking in the woods.
I want you to apologize to Tom.
I had had my watch repaired, but it broke again.
We have to figure out a way to encourage Tom to do the right thing.
Please stay where you are.

I broke my leg, so I won't be playing basketball for a few months.
Tom took Mary out for a drink.
I love flowers.

Start here.
Would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?
Tom would never wait that long.
Somebody's got to talk to them.
How does it feel to be famous?
I stayed home because of the weather.
Don't ask what the state can do for you, but why it doesn't do it.
I've still got a lot to learn.
Please give me a cup of tea.
Tom learned a few words in French.
When may I go home?
I told Tom about that.

Give it back to her.
He jumped out the window.
They accomplished their mission.
Is Tom smiling?
Tom is just a regular guy.
We'll have to pry the door open.

I didn't understand everything Tom said.
I think I know someone who can help.

The deadline had to be extended.
Do you want us to kill him?
I was looking for her everywhere.
Please support Lojban!
Unfortunately, this house has already been sold.
Even Tom can do it.

That red dress looks good on her.
It's very late now.
Let's sing a song.
Is there anything in this box?
You can't imagine how tired I am.
We're not exactly sure what it was.

Tom will get killed.
She's probably very busy.
Your mother is my relative.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
I don't think we can guarantee your safety.

You can't kill both of us.
I know the real reason for his absence.
Then what do you need the money for?
They started the meeting without me.
We'll have three guests tonight.

I'm sure you'll be able to do the job.
Tom thinks that he knows what Mary is doing.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I saw him tonight.
We're not strangers.
He is hated by everyone.
Tom looked at the ceiling.
I think I'll manage.
He was plastered.
Everything is OK. Don't worry.
Show Tom the magazine.
She sang pretty well.
He's better than us all.
We'll tell them.
Tom is an intelligent guy.
Let's stop by the hospital.
Why didn't you help me escape?
Why don't you play the banjo anymore?
I like to read.
Doesn't anyone care?
Thanks for everything.
I know Tom is in there.
I really like Tom.
I wouldn't recommend doing that.
Didn't you know Tom could play the guitar?
We won't be able to survive without your help.
Have you not learned to respect others?
The cherry trees are about to blossom.
You always do what you want.
He knows how to speak to children.
Just watch and learn.
I don't want to study German.
In Canada, there are many areas where it is illegal to log trees.
I was thinking about it.
I don't know when he will come back.
This partition separates the two rooms.
You'd better go.
This is a great question.
I forgave Tom for what he did.
This sentence is not French.
Tom looks good for his age.
I don't think I love you anymore.
We studied French in school.
Tom isn't mad at Mary anymore.
If you don't hurry, you'll miss the last train.
I hope you'll say yes.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors.
Tom knew that Mary wouldn't win.

It's him or me.
Don't you know that he passed away two years ago?
Tom could've done that.
Your beauty doesn't leave me indifferent.
He is pleased with his work.
She took her secrets to the grave.
This wall feels cold.
If I were you, I would follow his advice.
Tom wants to know how long we're going to be here.
It's really coming down out there!
A smirk crossed Mary's face.
Thanks again for coming.
Tom isn't violent.
Just let me see it.
I don't like those who say so.
I broke my arm when I was a child.
The people waiting for the bus seemed impatient.

Someone left the door open.
Tom still doesn't believe it.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
Why don't you adapt your way of life to circumstances?
This is my cow.
It is absolutely impossible.
I'd do the same for you.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Tom was thirty.
Different jobs require different tools.
I can't wait to tell them.

Tom warned him.
Bacchus has drowned more men than Neptune.
Did I wake you up?

Shut up!

What do you want me to say?
How can I see you?

I think it's best to accept his plan.
Tom wants my telephone number.
Finish this.
Don't look their daughters in the eyes.

Don't just stand there, say something.
Tom should've discussed the matter with me.
She got rid of her old books.
I'll talk with her.
You look pathetic in that outfit.
Tom has never lived anywhere other than Australia.
We hoped we'd succeed today.
I'm sure that's being done already.
The car made a right turn over there.
Please call the police.
What you told me wasn't true.

Everything happened by accident.
You seem very nervous this morning.

He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Can you do it by yourself?
We surprised Tom.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.

Now I remember.
My mother and father are the only people on the whole planet whom I will never begrudge a thing.

I love you!
I didn't know them then.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
Your father would've been very proud of you.
I was disappointed at the result.
Would Tom really eat this?
You don't look busy.
Why am I being handcuffed?
Two parallel lines are equidistant.
Nobody talks about it.
Both of us can speak French.
This is about cars.
You're not allowed in this room.
How did you recognize me?
Tom has already drunk three cups of coffee.
This is a good wine.
I bought a T-shirt.
Stay with him in this room.
The population of the world is increasing so rapidly that it will be doubled within forty years.
Do you live here?
Mary had enough money to buy everything she wanted.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
I need to be there by 2:30.
If you didn't want to go, you should have told me.
I don't like tea, so I usually drink coffee for breakfast.
Is it broken?
You can't drive.
Tom has been waiting for over three hours.
Tom is healthy.
I've been to Africa.
When I get through with my work, I'll call you.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
I'm not sure that I want Tom working for us.
Tom needed to go home early.
The policeman discovered counterevidence.
Tom owns some property in Boston.
It's a very strange case.
Listen carefully.
I need a hot shower.
Tom told me that he was afraid.
He's a well-informed person.
He had a crush on her.
The table is askew, it's likely going to turn over soon.
Instead of eating here, let's go home.
Tom doesn't want to go with you.
Have you never noticed how Tom looks at you?
She read a cookbook last night.
Tom had no complaints.
Can we talk about it?
Tom doesn't care, but I do.
He has a large family to provide for.
Tell Tom that I'm not home.
Tom has a house on Park Street.
I didn't think so.
Could you sign my book?
Don't weep, little Vasilissa. Grief is worst at night. Lie down, shut thine eyes, comfort thyself and go to sleep. The morning is wiser than the evening.
I was trying to protect her.
Let's turn on the heater.
I'm being paranoid, aren't I?
Haven't I told you not to call me Tom?
Tom won't get a chance to help.
I heard everything you just said.
Let's go and see.
Tom doesn't believe that Mary is happy.
A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car, but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.
All was silent throughout the castle.
Who am I talking to?
Did you like that book?
It's the perfect size.
This watch was given me by my uncle.
Are you satisfied with the result?
The doctor said that this sickness is irremediable.
Get down from there immediately.
I've already called you a taxi.
We're here to support you.
I almost got killed when I went into the burning house to save Tom.
Tom listens to his favourite music on his MP3 player when he goes for his morning walk.
"Psalms are boring" said the girl.
Cheese, butter, cream, yogurt and kefir are dairy products.
Life is not fair.
My name is Romanian; his is American.
I hate that they call me "four-eyes".
Tom asked me if I liked it.
I'm not here for a vacation.
Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan.
It'll be difficult to explain this.
I hate mosquitoes, but they seem to love me.
I go to the church on Sundays.
Tom takes a shower every day.
I'm loved by my parents.
Where will you put it?
Tom left at 2:30.
How do you manage to do this?
Do you want a car?
We shouldn't do that.
Tom asked Mary if she'd like a cup of coffee.
He seems to have told a lie.
He wanted to find his son.
Tom laughed at the joke.
This is outrageous!
It's strange that they worship the sun.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
Tom knows I can't do that very well.
He knows how to read Chinese.
I didn't steal it.
If it had not been for your help, I couldn't have completed the work.
Can you explain how this happened?
The flu is going around now.
Mary goes to school with my son.
Come on, don't be silly.
We needed this weather.
Tom nodded to Mary.
I think Tom will like this game.
Is that why you hired me?
Does this dress look good on me?
Your friend is here.
Be careful when going up the stairs.
They knew a lot of songs, too.
Be careful not to stand too close to the fire.
He wants to hug her.
Tom ate everything on his plate.
Do you really think Tom is alive?
I just graduated from Harvard.
She lived in the suburbs of Tokyo when she was young.
She pulled her hair into a ponytail.
I was an idiot to believe her.
I got what you asked for.
Tom said he would buy what was needed.
Keep them away from Tom.
Say hello to your father for me.
It's not fatal.
Eat as much as you want.
Excuse me, but could you get me a glass of water?
Your mother must've been beautiful when she was young.
We studied Chinese for 2 years.
Everybody will be sleeping by the time we get there.
I found her graceful.
Do you think Tom is still afraid?
Tom has a student visa.
I need to have a word with your father.
Please call me at seven tomorrow morning.
I cannot kiss Taninna. We are not married yet.
Stop blaming yourself.
I'm glad we stayed in Boston an extra day.
I would like you to answer my questions.
Why aren't you eating?
Tom did a lot more than that.
No one has been fired yet.
Tom fell asleep quickly.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
Why don't you give it to them?
As far as I know, there is no such function.
I'm not tired yet.
We did that ourselves.
You probably wouldn't understand this.
I never read the book.
Tom had a great love for his country.
We've been together for thirty years.
I saw a man holding a rabbit in his arms yesterday.
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
We usually speak to each other in French.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
You can play a musical instrument, can't you?
These chairs are made from wood.
I wonder if Tom is here.
Tom thought that it was a joke.
Tom doesn't want to give up his dream of becoming an astronaut.
The book I bought is on the table.
I might do that tomorrow.
Can I speak with you?
You'll hardly notice it.
He was walking toward the sea.
Come home early, Bill.
I must finish my work.
How did you manage to impress Tom?
This damn computer doesn't work.
Sooner or later he will tell me everything.
We sent you a letter.
Tom and Mary aren't invited.
They lost.
I think Tom would like that.
She finally found her keys.
He's unconscious.
There exists an enormous difference between the two theories.
You just bought yourself another day of detention.
Tom has a new hobby.
The medicine decreased his pain.
Tom used to live at that address.
He is accustomed to sitting up late.
We were expecting it.
I'm going out for a while.
It's too late. I'm dying.
You're still a teacher, aren't you?
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
Tom isn't new here.
It's snowing!
Words cannot describe the horror I experienced.
How far?
What's up, Tom?
She shot a glance at her mother.
He promised to help us.
Won't you come home?
Tom might've written to Mary already.
Some people are just weird.
Things don't just happen.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
You told me so yourself.
Tom, can you hear me?
I am German.
Tom blacked out.
Tom's lawyers say he was framed.
The girl is going to school, even though she wants to sleep.
Tom isn't cut out to be a teacher.
What else did you buy?
I wonder where Tom is now.
Tom is in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
Can I help with anything?
I suspect that Tom didn't do that.
You'd better hide somewhere.
I want to be loved by somebody.
Tom liked that.
Let us in.
I am dead.
Sometimes a flower should be enough to smile.
Tom would've done that differently.
I appreciated your joke.
How do you know that?
Where does all that noise come from?
People usually don't like what they don't understand.
What makes you think Tom is my type?
There are only 80 Uyghurs in Switzerland.
I went to Kobe by train.
I can't understand why Tom didn't win.
Why did you wake me up?
Tom knows that Mary went to Boston.
Tom is extremely shy.
Tom wants you to wash his car.
I really like the language I'm learning.
You're a philosopher, aren't you?
He always works a lot.
I've just arrived from Paris.
I just don't agree with you.
You must believe me.
I'd like to pay later.
Everybody ignored us.
If I were you, I wouldn't go there by myself.
It's empty.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
I know a lot of things.
I met him on the day I arrived here.
Tom is conscious now.
I have urgent business with you.
I never told you that.
I didn't want anyone to see me with Tom.
Do you think this can work?
He'll obey.
I was born like this.
My shoes are dirty.
I'd like you to call me Tom.
I never give my teacher problems.
I can't believe I'm here.
Don't blame him.
Mexico has half as many people as Japan.
Let me ask another question.
I see that it is raining.
How big is your dog?
I need some tea.
Tom's hungry.
How often do you see him?
That's for Tom and me.
Tom wasn't here last night.
I am just repeating what I have heard.
This is my job.
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?
That isn't the case in Japan.
It'll break.
These suitcases are heavy.
Tom's room is full of toys.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
The log floated down the river.
Tom tried that.
I thought you recognized him.
Does Tom know how to ride a horse?
Tom has a double chin.
We weren't expecting Tom to do that.
I'll go back and get it.
Most of the rooms have balconies with sea views.
This cat is white.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
Make it stop.
No matter how busy you are, you have to do your homework.
I knew that something wasn't right.
He didn't want me to phone him.
He can speak either English or French.
Do you do that every Monday?
Tom made Mary very happy.
"I'm sorry!" "It's nothing. Don't worry."
Get it away from me.
Tom asked Mary to speak to John about that.
Never contradict your elders.
This world is but canvas to our imaginations.
Unless you make a decision quickly, the opportunity will be lost.
The sky is obscure, I can see no star.
I followed him into the kitchen.
The situation seemed to call for immediate action.
He revenged himself.
What room is Tom in?
Today the society of Russia clearly lacks spiritual ties.
I sent a message to Tom.
I'm ready to put on a suit and go to work.
Tom was afraid of being laughed at.
You'd better not write here.
I didn't tell them anything.
I find you attractive.
"What happened?" "Nothing."
Let's go by train instead of by bus.
We ought to look the world straight in the face.
Why do you like it?
How many people will you invite?
How can you be so naive?
Is this the book you're looking for?
Why didn't you tell me in advance?
I'll wait till four o'clock.
Don't quarrel with your bread and butter.
I'd love to meet Tom.
Was that Tom?
There's nothing wrong with the formula.
Noriko is like her mother.
You may be right. But it doesn't matter.
Stay with us in this room.
He's always making such witty remarks!
I told them to stay here.
Tom is still working in Australia.
Wake me around seven o'clock.
I'm not feeling very well myself.
I will go even if it rains tomorrow.
Tom promised me he would come to the party.
Stop, please.
She has no sense of beauty.
I don't think Tom will mind.
It was nice to speak with Tom.
Tom is eager to live in Boston.
I felt sorry for her when I heard her story.
He acted fairly towards me.
I wanted to apologize to them.
I'd really like to help.
She weighs 120 pounds.
I have work on Wednesday.
You didn't have to leave.
You know where I work.
She is doing her homework now.
I thought you were together.
He washed the blood off his sword.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
I won't ask you to do that.
I've already started to do that.
Ken walked on crutches.
You can always come here.
I told you to get out.
I don't feel like cooking tonight.
She said she was tired of losing.
Frankly, I have no idea what's going on here.
Tom looks thoughtful.
The road is blocked.
I had no idea that he was your husband.
Where would you like to go?
Mary has spent all her money.
She got a master's degree three years ago.
Tom double-crossed me.
He'll do that if you pay him to.
I love him and he loves me.
She named him Charles.
Tom is the coach.
I've only heard good things about him.
He's a bad ass.
Tom, look what I found under the sofa.
You don't need to wait.
What were you told?
Tom wants to go job hunting.
I am cold.
Tom said not to wait.
It could be the biggest mistake you ever make.
Tell Tom to meet me at Mary's.
Tom is only three years older than me.
Tom isn't off duty today, is he?
They answered their teacher's question with difficulty.
I didn't want to cause trouble.
Tom isn't in his tent.
We'll be at home all day today.
Tom had no idea what I was talking about.
I can't do that job.
Have you been to France before?
What museums would you recommend I visit?
You didn't commit a serious crime.
Why don't you just tell Tom you made a mistake?
It rained all day.
I really need this job.
I think something scared Tom.
Those bananas are delicious.
Tom doesn't drink alcoholic drinks at all.
Can't we fire them?
Bring me the magazines.
You are at home.
He is too young to go there alone.
I'm usually right.
Your house is on fire!
You could've run away.
Which movie did you like most this year?
I am on good terms with him.
According to the news, there will be a typhoon tomorrow.
I missed you a lot while you were in Boston.
I brush my teeth every day.
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle.
That's why I like him.
I'd never do a thing like that.
There is not a word of truth in it.
Tom and Mary both know that that's unlikely to happen.
Mary said she wanted to play.
Why don't you do it yourself?
The weakest link in the chain is also the strongest. It can break the chain.
Where will you go?
Tom won't come back here.
Tom gave me a lift home.
Do you want any help, Tom?
You're my girlfriend.
Do you like swimming?
I just solved the puzzle.
She cleaned her room in a hurry.
Tom and Mary barely know each other.
Tom told me that he was diabetic.
I asked Tom to go there.
I'd hoped to see them in Boston.
We're not guilty.
The film should have already started.
Keep the fire alive.
Wash the quince thoroughly.
I told Tom Mary wanted to do that.
I think that there are a lot of good-looking women in Australia.
Tom doesn't want people to know about that.
I don't intend to do this forever.
Is that really Tom's sister?
Tom asked Mary where she'd parked her car.
This time, you won't avoid your punishment.
I don't know anybody else here.
Many castles are in ruins.
The embryos and fetuses of all mammals look quite similar.
I travel often.
Could you all turn off the lights?
It is true that he is young, but he is wise.
Everyone believed us.
I understand that you're angry.
The child pretended that it was asleep.
Tom found a good job near his house.
Tom isn't going anywhere.
That's why I don't like you.
He has lost his job.
I can't eat this crud!
If you want a good seat, you should get there early.
Tom took his time.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
Do you know what that is?
Tom won't make you happy.
You're contagious.
What should I tell the kids now?
Tom decided not to go.
Don't make me do it.
I knew that I could do that.
I'll have none of it.
The view from the top of the mountain took my breath away.
Show me how much money you have.
My dog has fleas.
Tom may have seen it.
Tom told me he was afraid that Mary might kill him.
You look as pale as a ghost.
The ring is tight.
May I come in?
I have another sister.
You should have done a language study abroad.
Aren't you going to tell Tom?
Tom pretended not to notice.
They are my friends.
Tom had a very important decision to make.
We've discussed many topics.
The front door stood wide open.
Mary is Tom's younger sister.
What were you planning to do?
He will go to Tokyo tomorrow, won't he?
He's a big boy.
Mary will do that, won't she?
I think Tom is hiding from Mary.
I've hired Tom.
We're often wrong but never in doubt.
You loved him.
Where exactly do you want to go?
They acted immediately by agreement.
The typhoon prevented us from going back to Tokyo.
Tom liked learning French.
I'd like Tom to be happy.
I want to buy a shirt.
Why do you hate Tom?
Tom and Mary have decided to get married next month.
Open the drapes.
I can't imagine how much more colourless life would be without multiple languages.
Ignore him.
I refuse to use plastic bags.
I felt humiliated.
Stop beating around the bush and give it to me straight!
Let's stay out of each other's way.
Tom understands what you don't.
I am a radio ham.
I'd never permit you to do that.
Thunderstorms are predicted.
I only have one suggestion.
It looks like my work here is done.
I cast about for a suitable reply.
I can't call him.
We weren't invited.
Tom says he did nothing illegal.
I'm okay.
Use a rake and rake up the leaves in the yard.
I'm done.
How the hell did you get here first?
Are you already in Boston?
I don't care if you believe me.
Tom says he intended to do that.
Tom didn't have to hurry.
"What time is it?" "It's 2:30."
I didn't know that that was going to happen.
I should go back to work now.
Tom filled his thermos with coffee.
My flight was delayed.
How did this happen to me?
Tom spent the night at a friend's house.
I'll open it.
He's about the same age as you.
Why are you away again?
Once a noob, always a noob.
Tom took a taxi because he was in a hurry.
Someone else told Tom. It wasn't me.
How did Amy look?
We need to take a short break.
It exceeded my expectations.
She wants you to help her do that.
Tom isn't an engineer.
What you said made him angry.
They did not see anything.
You can't be sure of that.
Tom invited Mary to his house.
You left us no choice.
Tell us about your new book.
Tom has a lot of screwdrivers.
The cake is still warm.
This is your chance to be heard.
I live in Australia with my family.
You have to tell us.
I'm good friends with her.
Mark is so honest that everyone praises him for it.
They are reading a book.
I've missed you so much.
I think Tom likes Mary.
The shop is open all day.
I like Toki Pona.
It's a common symptom.
Hey, quit complaining.
I put it back.
She almost passed out.
Can you get there by car?
I'll ask them.
I know where to find her.
I would like to be your pen pal.
Tom is older than your father.
I heard the boys singing.
I'll try to find out where it is.
Did Tom give any other suggestions?
Are you interested in politics?
I recognized you.
Do you think we can help Tom?
He cannot be trusted.
Is this all you can give me?
Tell Tom I don't have his money.
The bus didn't have any passengers on board at the time of the accident.
Tom is suffering from a cold.
Tom assured me that it won't happen.
I listened.
Tom has prostate cancer.
Tom was a very rich man before he got married.
The coffee is bitter because I didn't put any sugar in it.
When I speak French, most of the people in the room don't understand me.
I love the way you talk.
I'm firmly opposed to corporal punishment.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom bought it.
Where did you learn to shoot?
I detest having to hurry in the morning.
You forgot her name.
Nobody heard me.
Make a note of it in order not to forget it.
I thought that you said that it was yours.
You aren't dressed.
Will I have time to eat?
Nothing's broken.
My blood type is A positive.
Had it not been for your courage, you would have been killed.
I found it difficult to be kind to others.
Tom doesn't understand this.
Hey, wait a minute.
I won't have time to read everything.
Try!
When is the test?
Tom agreed to Mary's plan.
Are there any detours up ahead?
What do you want from them?
What did you hide?
Don't underestimate them.
We loved them.
He is in love with her, but he tries to conceal his feelings.
Tom can't stand still.
Do you want me to talk to Tom about that?
It is of great value.
That looks suspicious to me.
They were hunting for bodies among the ruins.
Tom left empty-handed.
You can't threaten me.
It gave me the creeps.
Have you talked to her?
My brother swims every day in summer.
They just want to talk to her.
I'm going to ask you something I've never asked before.
Don't expect anything to change.
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
There were too many of them.
Mary is taking off her shoes.
Did you ever work with her?
I'd like to know the reason.
Your T-shirt's on backwards.
He has three children.
I thought you loved reading.
Will you go?
The train left before they got to the station.
Magdalena and Lech are preparing for their Polish exams.
He apologized to the teacher for coming to school late.
You're the cook.
Why did you invite her?
He seems kind.
What a beautiful dress!
It is either Cesar or nothing.
Tom will eat cake.
Didn't you know that Tom was in Australia?
Tom was in a very jocular mood after being given a raise by his boss.
You're very disorganized.
I can't do anything until this project is done.
Tom isn't a rich man.
She couldn't find her keys.
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.
The flower will come out soon.
I didn't help her escape.
I can't let you.
That probably didn't happen.
Tom hopes that Mary will win.
Father recovered his health.
Mary giggled and blushed.
Take that!
At the end of his life, Hokusai lived in misery, alone with his daughter, and worked until his death.
Tom has asked us for help.
"Can you tell the teacher where I'm going?" "I got you."
A man named Slim was killed in that accident.
Tom was obviously not expecting us to be here.
I knew you were there.
Tom knows Mary probably won't do that.
I'll ask Tom to make you something to eat.
Tom saw Mary dancing with John.
I think you should go there by car.
They wanted to give Koko a new pet.
I had no idea you could dance.
Why didn't you tell Tom about that?
Tom has a plane to catch.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Our budget is very limited.
It's always the same.
I was in my bedroom.
Why didn't you tell me that?
We've just got to do something.
I've never seen her wear jeans.
Tom can't stand Mary.
We didn't bring it with us.
No one has said a word.
She's a beauty.
Straighten your back!
How much time does that require?
Where's your money?
I was on vacation.
She only eats salads.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
She'll probably regret what she did.
I flushed the toilet.
He should have come.
Who are the world doping champions?
Tom must've been drunk.
She took his book.
I hope you never forget me.
That's not true!
They looked very busy.
That's my last word.
Tom accused him of having stolen the bike.
He would be as muscular as his brother if he had worked out like him.
May I use your phone?
I returned to my seat.
Why are you helping them?
I love my dad.
For more information, please visit our website.
Taken by surprise, I was at a loss for what to answer.
Tom told me that I'm first.
Are you still afraid of snakes?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
Tom didn't wait for Mary.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
It's the same old problem.
Oh, please, stop that noise!
I like history.
I need to stop reading the news.
Tom arrived at 2:30.
Do you believe what he said?
What'll they do to Tom?
I said Paul was out, but that Mary was at home.
Tom barricaded himself inside his room.
Tom isn't an actor.
When was the last time you prayed?
He has a smattering of Greek.
Just listen to us.
Tell her that I am cutting the meat.
The cat clawed its owner.
Ouch! I bit my tongue.
Are you telling me Tom doesn't do that anymore?
Your situation is analogous to mine.
Sally earns her living by giving piano lessons.
What exactly will you be doing?
He is a born artist.
Let's not talk.
Many Jews were expelled by the Germans.
I said I'd go.
Don't you have any feelings for him at all?
This is a story written in English.
She's from Lisbon.
Look, I know you're busy.
Shishir is following me.
Tom is going to join us later.
He will not agree with us.
Are you afraid of bats?
Do you recognize this key?
I see the queen.
I don't know anything yet.
Tom didn't know how to do that until I showed him.
I want to hear about your trip!
I know how to handle Tom.
There's a bird over here.
He was not disappointed.
They unwrapped their sandwiches.
I heard him come in.
Tom was the only one that was arrested.
We'll miss you when you're not here.
Unfortunately, no one deals with this question.
I know precisely how Tom and Mary feel.
Boston is one of my favorite cities.
Tom will get it fixed.
They eat healthy foods.
I don't know anyone who lives in Boston.
Tomorrow is payday.
One thing should not be forgotten: a program cannot think.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
I feel happy because I am quit of that trouble.
We ordered Chinese food.
My question requires a response.
What are you smiling about?
You can tell her I said so.
Tom has three sisters.
When did you learn how to swim?
Mary and Alice pretended they were sisters.
Tom took a sip from his coffee mug.
This one's not bad either.
There are many earthquakes in Japan.
I've been seen.
We're doing what we love to do.
Please use the water with economy.
It may never happen again.
There's no time for this.
Tom hates eating alone.
Tom and I see each other every day at school.
He didn't acknowledge defeat.
You'll have to work a lot.
Tom is looking for an apartment.
Are you going to wait?
When do you play tennis?
Tom may go to Australia next week.
Do you want a bite?
Who'll pay for this?
Smokers are far more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers are.
Mom already said yes.
Why did you help Tom escape?
You don't even look at me.
Thanks, guys!
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
The escalator suddenly stopped.
Beowulf became king of the Geats.
I've been to Boston numerous times.
Morning!
I think there's hope for you yet.
I became his friend.
When in doubt, just take the next small step.
Tom was nothing but skin and bone.

I'm a slob.
I know Tom very well.
Come here. I'll show you something.

I think that's highly unlikely.

This doesn't help.
Humans come from apes.
Come on up here.

By the way, my English is absolutely hopeless.
You must do as I tell you.
He adores his children.
Where did you learn to do that?
Finally, Tom stood up and headed for the door.
Have you been adopting sentences in order to correct them?
He's not coming, according to Mary.
That incident put his courage to the test.
Today is a special day.
I had no idea you were so good at cooking.
Was Tom afraid?
Tom said he now regrets his decision.
I saw Tom smile yesterday.
Firstly: We, your forebears, cannot help you from the land beyond. Secondly: The slayer of wheelchairs came here incognito and therefore could only have brought a small number of guards with him. And thirdly: there is (supposedly) no beautiful princess. Got all that? Well, then have fun with your task.
Tom hugged Mary close.
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.

They're still together.
Tom told me why he didn't want to do that.
Was I about to die?
Take a step back.
What would you like to be when you grow up?
Mary lost her umbrella again.
I have to tell them.
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
This is the best one.
Which one is best?
This dog doesn't bite.
I wonder what made Tom cry.
I do need you.
I didn't think you'd leave so early.
Tom told Mary he was going to Australia.
This wine is very expensive.
If I knew her address, I would write her a letter.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
I think I have a broken rib.
Everyone knows we didn't do that.
I had a flu shot.
I wanted to hire a coach.
I read that book while I was in the hospital.

I love you and think about you all the time.
Then what do you need the money for?
Tom has a high fever.
Everyone stopped talking and stared at me.
I don't think that Tom is at home.
May I have this book?
I'm thinking of opening up a store.
She'll lend you hers.
I'm glad you came today.
Let's leave the decision to Tom.
The sunshine was dazzling.
Did you turn off the gas?
It's very difficult to transport them overland, but simple to do so by sea.
This is a huge loss.
I don't think it will work.
Tom tricked us again.
Do apples grow on trees, or vines?
Tom might know the answer.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
I guess that's normal.
I'm naked.

Who is writing these comments?
When do you write?

Repetition plays a very important role in language learning.
How many apples do you want me to buy?

Here's a new one.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
What are you talking about?
She accused me of telling a lie.
Tom was sitting at the next table.
Once a teacher, always a teacher.
Are we prepared?
I won't bother you.
When are you going back to Japan?
Haven't I told you not to call me Tom?
Why didn't you just tell me what it was?
Are you absolutely sure of that?
Mary told me she'd walk to work tomorrow morning.
Tom underwent surgery.
Tom was having a lot of fun.

Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
It will not be long before it rains.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
I have no plans.
I lied to both of you.
The man regained the use of his left arm.
Tom doesn't know what it means.
Tom didn't work last Monday.
A lot of people saw you at the scene of the accident.
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to meet Tom.
She took a hot bubble bath surrounded by scented candles.
Please unbutton your blouse.
Ask Tom.
When did you start?
That didn't even occur to me.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Must I write in ink?
I am not waiting for this to change.
I'm dining out this evening.
It looks like you're wrong.
I'll tell them you asked.
Let me out of here.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tom wanted to keep his bicycle in my garage.
They had a boat.
There are books about art on the table.

Faith, unity, discipline.
I was completely shocked.
I want to speak to her.
This book is Tom's.
I'm glad to see you here.
Tom always carries a map and compass in his bag.
Singing comes as naturally to her as flying does to birds.
As the saying goes, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
He spoke very well.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Stop correcting me.
I live in Montenegro.
Few people expected him to win.
What's this got to do with you?
Did you try the chicken?
Nobody's asking you for money.
That was a weird feeling.
How exactly do you know her?
I didn't know you could cook like this.
The man seized him by the neck.
Tom seems busy.
Why did you give up the idea of learning French?
Why do you need to leave today?
His little sister is fuckable.
Tom was so surprised he was speechless.
The gardener was the murderer.
It'll be a long winter.
It always snows here in winter.

Make a list and stick to it.
If you want to lose weight, spend a day without meals.
Give Tom some cookies.
I haven't got a chance.
Reading gives me great pleasure.
Tom lost consciousness.
I wrote my name in the sand.
It would be a huge setback for them.
I'm convinced Tom had nothing to do with what happened.
I think we should run.
Is he married or single?
You'll see, it's hard to please her.
Are you all mad?
That could literally ruin my life.
They didn't succeed.
They helped her.
Don't promise anything.
Did you have a good weekend?
See you tomorrow at 2:30.
Why didn't you tell them?
Tom knows something I don't.
He told me he was sick.
She is eating an orange.
I saw her jump into the pool.
She did what we wanted her to do.
I think they are a competent person.
He said Bill Clinton would raise taxes.
Can you tell me about them?

I think I need help.
I didn't want my mom to know.
Mary never wears makeup.
Ask him yourself.
I bought this for my mother.
Tom noticed Mary's hands shaking.
I cleared the roof of snow.
Without your help, we wouldn't have finished in time.
Tom knows he's right.
I was ready today.
Tom will be very busy next week.
They're paid to do that.
Do you get along with your boss?
Are you a dog person or a cat person?
She implored him to come back.
She picked up one of the glass vases.
I've always known that someday Tom would leave us.
You shouldn't go.

I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
What caused the fight?
Can you break a 1000 yen bill?
Tom is the only one likely to be able to help you.
Tom did that very carefully.
You're gregarious.
I'm faster than you.
I'm proud to have you on our team.
This can't be!
Tom pulled a muscle.
Most people who eat with a fork live in Europe, North America, and South America; people who eat with chop sticks live in Africa, the Near East, Indonesia, and India.

His actions had irrevocable consequences.
What's there to discuss?
I had a date with Jane last night.

I thought about you all day.
Tom is looking for someone to help him translate a document from French into English.

I'm very fast.
Is it dangerous?

They saved trouble and expense by doing it themselves.
Did you remember to take your medicine?

He's already here.
Tom asked Mary about the traffic accident she was involved in when she was five years old.
You already did that.
If you can't come, send someone in your stead.
Tom said that he and Mary would probably be a little late.
I thought Tom would be in Boston by now.
Japan is located in Asia.
I should've declined.
You are wasting your time.
The sniper picked off his victims one by one.
Tom thinks you're doing that wrong.
You're not ready yet, are you?
He'll change.
I bought it from her.
They did well on the exercises.
He told his son an interesting story.
I hope you're well rested.
Tom left his key in the lock.
I want to get back to Boston.
We men are used to waiting for the women.
I'm a very light sleeper.
I'm not sure either.
I hope you don't drink too much.
You're such a flirt.
Who switched off the lights?
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
I'm in low spirits today.
They promised me that they wouldn't be late.
Tom ate the whole apple in less than three minutes.

Smell what's in this bottle.
I didn't ask Tom.
You just have to adapt.
I'll call you when I'm ready.
I met Tom in jail.
Are you close to your parents?
He gave me some money.
I'm afraid you'll have to learn to live with the pain.
Tell me again how much money you have.
You should have kept it secret.
You are working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
Tom watched in horror.
How tall is that mountain?
We're going to do things our way.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out about this?
What's really bothering you?
The woman who killed my sister should be hanged.
I'm going to work on this.
She said she'd wait for us.
He said that he didn't know you.
He hated school.
There's no rush.
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
My mouth waters when I read cooking books.
Tom saw us do that.
"I missed you a lot." "I missed you too!"
I've got to talk to her.
Tom wanted to go.
Thanks for coming.
Call me if you find something.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
It's not because of that.
You shouldn't have done that without my permission.
She loves her older brother.
Did Tom agree to do it?
Don't forget to tell Tom.
More than 75% of farms raised pigs and milk cows.
I understand that you're angry.
You said you would marry me.
I've got everything we need.
My mother told me not to be noisy.
Why did Tom leave Boston?
There was no respite from the cold.
I never promised you anything.
I speak French, too.
The problem is you're not patient enough.
Next Monday is a holiday.
I know that something horrible has happened.
"You know, you were right about Tom. He proved to be every bit as unreliable as you said he was." "I rest my case."
Where did you get this, Tom?
I see you every now and then.
Tom told me to answer your questions.
I just can't believe Tom won.
That's all I want to know.
Tell her I didn't read it.
My father used to go to work by bus.
Tom heard that Mary was sick.
I try with all my might.
Tom is a bit conceited.
I don't come here every day.
I love this part.
Tom and Mary walked down the street, holding hands.
Did you go to the club?
That's a pretty good question.
Are you related to them?
If by any chance I'm late, please don't wait for me.
Call the doctor so that he confirms the appointment.
I knew Tom wouldn't be back.
I folded the towel in half.
He solved the difficult problem easily.
I felt invincible.
You're unfair.
Have you seen any new movies recently?
Mary unbuttoned her jacket.
Tom wanted to talk to his children.
Have you considered asking Tom to help you?
Who'll attend?
Mary saw her name on the list.
Has Tom become crazy?
His brother bullied me.
Before leaving home, I checked to see if I had forgotten anything.
I don't want to listen to your explanations.
You're our neighbor.
I didn't mean to startle you.
Don't forget your friends.
We're thinking of you.
Monday will probably be a rainy day.
Aren't you hungry?
Tom got married when he was 30 years old.
I didn't want to leave.

Have I told you that I hate you?
I'm glad you're letting me do this.
I have several meetings this afternoon.
Tom got very sick and almost died.
They're both unmarried.
You're a nobody.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
Have you found out anything?
It was sort of a weird feeling.
I brought you some coffee.
Tom is still married to Mary, isn't he?
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
I don't have enough time.
I can come back tomorrow.
Let's finish it now.
You know what drives me crazy?
Tom will understand.
The cat has two ears.
He isn't interested in girls at all.
We can fix anything.
He was sharpening a knife.
I didn't mean to confuse him.
Everyone has enemies.
Where was it published?
We've got to help Tom.
Did the policeman speak nonsense?
Tell Tom to call me.
I forgot that French was your native language.
Tell me all about the trip you've made.
I came here as fast as I could.
I was only gone an hour.
I just don't feel like doing my math homework.
Make me another one.
You can put it there.

The situation is extremely critical.
We're giving a party tonight.
Your French has improved considerably.
We are men.
I've got to go meet her.
Do you still love Tom?
What if I get caught?
Where do you come from and where are you going?
Tom has been executed.
She told me she'd try.
Why can't you come here?
I am looking for my brother.
How's your brother?
We have three weeks.
That might help.
She knew something was wrong.
She refused my friend request.
I'm a stubborn man.

Yellow fever and smallpox were no longer a threat.
I haven't read the report.
I don't think that it's necessary to do that.

Did you speak to him?
That's when I knew Tom was lying.
You can study IP related material during work hours when you have time to spare.
We're moving in the right direction.
You have to study English step by step.
I'm trying to understand you.

We've got to fix it.
I don't get your point.
Eat your peas.
Do you like what you do?
I'm not a refugee.
Do you speak Urdu?
Thousands of homes were destroyed by the flood.
Tom found it.
What are you arguing about?
Don't come here anymore.
Tom wanted to talk about what happened.
I want you to say you're not going back to Boston.
Does Tom think that I can help?
I hate writing letters.
I don't understand what you are talking about.
Tom scratched his cheek.
A really impressive book – Signature in the Cell, by Stephen C. Meyer. It shows how a transcendental intelligence operates in the cell.
You're being ridiculous.
I'll get my bag.
Tom is quite reliable.
Turn it off, please.
Tom is going to agree.
He quickly mastered Russian.
Who was in second place?
It is not proper that you talk that way.
I check my mailbox almost every day.
Tom must be hiding something.
Tom will do the same.
Expect no mercy.

We prepared for an attack.
Your T-shirt will dry soon.
They declined the invitation.
In God We Trust.
Are you conservative?
I think that Tom isn't Canadian.
I want to apologize to you for calling you a jerk in front of your girlfriend.
He paused at the door, undecided as to whether he should enter or not.

I'm proud to be your father.
He said that he'd found something.
Did you arrest her?
I can't believe we're here.
I didn't attend his funeral.
Who can run fastest in your class?
Tom was obviously very drunk.
I go to the beach almost every day.
I help my wife with the housework.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I have never been to Paris.
Tom is a lot better than people think.
You know that that's a lie.
I can teach you how to sell.
The lights were on, but nobody was home.
I'll be eternally grateful if you do that.
It looks great from up here.
Do what you believe is right.
I know Tom is watching me.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Wolves don't usually attack people.
Do you want me to take my shoes off?

Did you love her?
That's what my mom always said.

Do you like lasagna?
You drive.

Someone's talking.
Quit clowning around!
Track and field is the most interesting part of the Olympic Games.

Tom looks angry.
Your parents know where you are.
Tom said he didn't know how to swim very well.
We've seen them.
You don't listen.
We must clean up the kitchen.
Didn't you bring anything?
It's not just about the money.
How did you know Tom was lying?
You're my cousin.
I don't know how many years Tom lived in Boston.
My father often goes abroad on business.
I don't trust this data.
I'll stay with him.
I don't want to see it.
Tom told me to go away.
Tom isn't working today.
Do you know that crying boy?
I feel really tired.
Do you want me to ask him?
If Tom calls, tell him we're on our way.

Do you like movies?
Tom cleaned the fish.
You need a car.
Whom did you visit yesterday afternoon?
I know you think I'm crazy.

Let's burn these leaves.
Mary, stop it. That's enough.
He is always punctual.
She slowly opened her eyes.
Stop talking about work.
Why were you waiting for me?
May I quote you?
It's cold in the basement.
It's what I want.
Haven't I told you never to call me here?
I almost didn't wait for you.
They can’t dance.
All you had to do was talk to Tom.
Call my husband.
Open the drapes.
I like going fishing with Tom.
I didn't think Mary would go to Boston by herself.
Tom didn't stay here for long.
My brother isn't home.
I'm sure you never told me not to do this.
I know you're doing your best.
Tell me the reason why they are absent.
What else was in the basket?
Tom was supposed to help me, but he didn't.
He's always been living in Tokyo.
Tom taught me to play chess.
It's too dark to read in here.
Tom knows Mary will win.
I was in the shower when the phone rang.

It scared me to death.
The plans for the offensive were secret.
Tom and I've known each other three years.
I checked twice.
That's a complicated question.
I knew you would come.
I wanted to go.
I am planting beans in my garden.
For some reason, they didn't include my name on the list.
No one was listening to me.
With the exception of Mike, everyone was at the party.
She's just a babe in the woods.
She's materialistic and vain.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
Be careful.
Tom was only joking.
What did you and Tom eat for lunch?
I won!
Do you have any glasses for three-eyed people?
I know it's there.

Tell us what that is.
You, come here.
Tell him thanks but no thanks.

We're no longer children.
Stop, or I'll shoot!

He was made to do it against his will.
No one agreed with him.
Please tell me about your teacher.
Cover your mouth.
Let's meet on Sunday.
Don't leave the soy sauce in a glass. I thought it was coffee or something and was about to drink it.
Every evening, he gets really drunk.
How can that be?
Whatever could it have been?
Nobody visits me.
Why are girls so obsessed with clothes?
I don't think Tom knows why Mary is ignoring him.
I could kiss you.
Even writing in one's native language is a challenge.
Why do people kiss?
Hold on.
There were way too many people in the room.
I'm being eaten alive by mosquitoes.
Ziri has big green eyes.
Were you happy?

Do you see patients on Saturdays?
How did that all happen?
I want a jar of preserves.
He changed his clothes.
You bought the ticket for the train?
Unbelievable!
You don't need to hurry.
He gave me a watch.
The car didn't stop.
Do you live near here?
The sickness is taking its course.
I have to admit that you're right.
I'm running from the girl.
I have a headache today.
We got lost in the streets.
You explained it very well.
Tom has already told me that he isn't going to do that.
You're not going to win.
Ask him.
Where did he find the key?
In most cases we had to give in to their demands.
It's all your fault, Tom.
I'm living proof that death can be overcome.
Never end a sentence with a preposition.

This is what you've been waiting for.
Stop staring at me.
Tom knew that he'd have to tell Mary the truth.

We've found something.
I wanted to talk with you alone.
I am leaving next week.

I think you need to call Tom.
You've been had.
Mary is starting to look a lot like her mother.
This is my family.
I wanted Tom to win.
What country's flag is that?
I bought it at a thrift shop.
I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
Did Tom tell you about the fire?
I can drive, if you like.
Tom forgot my birthday again this year.
Where did Tom get the recipe?
What are you lining up for?
Can I smoke?
I know what Tom would do.
Are you awake?
Tom swam in the river.
I really don't know anything about that.
Don't forget to put an accent mark!
Did you manage to get something to eat?
He had a good time in the restaurant.
I know Tom will be back.
If you don't miss the train, you'll get there on time.
Welcome to your new home.
Why don't people hibernate?
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
Do you want this one or that one?
It's hard.
I'd like you to live with me.
When will your father come home?
I want to watch her suffer.
Do you have them?
How much money do you owe her?
Tom asked me where my car was parked.
She shot him with a rifle.
I did it for you and Tom.
A good idea occurred to me then.
Tom called the police to report that Mary was missing.
Nothing makes sense.
Why does he always arrive late?
I confess I'm afraid to go by myself.
We both saw her.
You're eating.
It was like a dream.
Their father is a taxi driver.
I should change the sentence.
Think about your children!
Who wouldn't like that?
Why do you want to see me?
If you need something, just call me.
How come I've never seen you here before?
Stars are beautiful.
Are you still in love with Tom?
It's in the kitchen.
What did you think of Tom's house?
This desk cost me no less than 30000 yen.
This is our land.
I was wrong about her.
We're closed.
Please tell him that I called.

They told me they'll do that tomorrow.
I'm busy now.
What do you know about that?
I explained it to Tom.
Tom started to sit where he usually sits, but Mary asked him to sit somewhere else.
Has anyone told Tom about what happened?
We didn't expect them to buy a new car.
I know you're not like that!
Why have you been avoiding Tom?
Tom sat down again.
All of us like him.

I don't want to tell you how I did that.
Tom wants you to help him today.
He's in Tokyo.
Is that your son?

I've never seen you so happy.
The most important thing in life is to be yourself.
If Tom is going, I'm going, too.
Tom and Mary aren't doing very well.
Save it on the external hard drive.
You're a happy man, Tom.
Why did you turn off the TV?
Tom isn't old enough to drive.
Why is Tom still awake?
I play with my cat.
He is near forty.
I know what Tom wants.
How do you find his new novel?
He has been studying French for eight years.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
I wish I had the chance to learn Russian.
I was in awe of Tom's courage.
Tom says that Mary did that.
They stopped to talk.
Why did you decide to learn French?
I saw my name on the list.
Do you want me to turn the light off?
You said it was important.
Should I have not done that?
Tom brushes his teeth at least three times a day.
Are you completely crazy?
That car is no doubt in an awful condition.
Tom has brown hair.
I had to decline the invitation because I was ill.
This restaurant's coffee is good.
The teacher took part in the children's games.
Don't give up.
We'll remain here.
I now regret saying what I said.
Tom can play the piano.
Tom has never been to my house.
You're modest.
This new shop will open in a week.
I bought a glass vase.
I'm going to write their names down before I forget them.
This fish is full of bones; don't eat it.
I'm too weak.
I have something that I want to say to him.
I go to the same school as Tom.
Peel it.
He is writing a book.
Clean up that mess.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
Could you be a little more exact?
Tom didn't violate his parole.
Are you stupid?
I need to charge my cellphone.
Do you miss your kids?
She liked men, if truth were told, a tiny wee bit more than women.
They invited me to the party.
Don't make fun of me when I'm talking seriously.
Tom didn't have to go to the hospital.
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
Do you like Moscow?
Don't you think I'm attractive?
Why are you sleepy?
I'll ask later.
You don't seem to realize how serious this is.
Tom recommended Mary.
You look surprised.
Is it safe to eat food that has dropped on the floor?
My bicycle is much newer than yours.
I told you not to worry.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here?
I had never seen her cry.
Tom is going to love living in Boston.
I thought Tom loved me.
Thank you for helping me to do my homework.
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
I'm meeting him in ten minutes.
At first, it is difficult.
She added water.
I'm very grateful to you.
I knew he was waiting for Mary.
Tom knew I was ready.
My sister is a twenty-one-year-old college student.
People will talk.
Together, the two of us have nothing to fear.
Tom and Mary are busy.
It's interesting that both of you have the same name.
Maybe there's still time.
Should I put all the meat in the soup?
The glottis is part of the larynx.
We've been invited to the opening ceremony.
Have you ever even met her?
She was afraid to make a speech.
I'm not going to school today.
Tom doesn't think that'll happen.
I'm glad you're not a coward like Tom.
I don't know much about sports.
I should've changed the oil.
He doesn't know who else to turn to.
The plan is bound to succeed.
Julia stood on tiptoes to reach a mug on the top shelf.
Tom wouldn't like this.
I heard Tom talking to somebody on the phone.
Composers create music.
I learned to write with my left hand.
Tom married a woman from Boston.
Did you see grandpa's wheelchair?
They were well-trained and well-supplied.
If you need to leave, then leave.
You can understand me.
Everyone is averting their eyes.
That's a very catchy melody.
I like the colour violet.
Two pages are missing from this book.
Markku seemed pleasantly surprised.
Give it a try.
Tom counted the money.
They're not a threat.
You are the only one who can help me.
Tom made a Greek salad.
I owe Tom for this.
It isn't here.
Tom advised Mary to take her umbrella with her.
Stuff happens.
Is it a boy or a girl?
You can't make me do anything I don't want to do.
"I'm bored!" "Then find something to do! I'm not here to entertain you."
Tom drank some wine.
I didn't have enough proof.
I thought you were kidding.
I should go warn them.
Tom says the noise doesn't bother him.
Would you want to live like that?
Tom doesn't need to go if he doesn't want to.
You're playing with fire.
She doesn't want to leave him.
Someone left you a message.
I don't like your name.
Tom is considered an expert in his field.
I wasn't the one singing.
I recently met Tom and Mary in a supermarket.
You're a beautiful woman.
In case of fire, break the glass and push the red button.
The vase is on the table.
I'll see her today.
You can't trust anything he says.
Terrific!
Just give it to him.
You are as white as a sheet.
"I am running for President, because sitting back is not an option anymore, or else this country is going to fall apart." "You do understand that enacting change requires more than just a good president?" "How do you mean?"
We didn't know each other at the time.
The well-known social networking sites Facebook and Twitter operate under the United States Constitution and California state law.
Tom arrived at the right time.
This report leaves a lot to be desired.
You need to leave.
Nobody wants to be my friend anymore.
We haven't changed anything yet.
Did we wake you up?
Why did you come alone?
I'm not sure how long this will take.
I only eat fruit.
Tom said that you'd understand.
I knew you were lying.
We spoke to each other in French.
I stole this from him.
I don't eat oysters.
I'll send a letter to my mother.
Mary said that she was fine.
Thirteen people were killed in the train wreck.
They made him work from morning till night.
It isn't predictable.
How many men does it take to replace an empty toilet roll? No one knows, it's never happened.
Let's go back to the beginning.
I know that Tom is a brave man.
It was Tom's and my turn.
The flat also has a small balcony.
Don't trouble trouble until trouble troubles you.
I know you're vegetarians.
You'd love it.
I feel so happy today.
Do you know how to make lasagna?
Have you written to him?
Don't forget about Tom.
I like German more than English.
Peel the orange and give me a piece.
It doesn't make any sense.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm an atheist.
Tom couldn't get the book he wanted.
I was a healthy child.
Doesn't love always begin that way?
I didn't know that Tom had children.
She poured me a cup of tea.
That house belongs to me.
I'm not sure what that means.
Why are you being followed?
What does she say?
I'll go next.
Tom is going with you, isn't he?
I don't know why the English pronoun "I" always appears with a capital letter.
Tom saw something in the woods that scared him.
It'll be dark by the time we get to Boston.
Do you have a back exit?
Nobody knows where he lives.
I met Tom on my way here.
I'm not proud to be an American.
It is not very polite, either.
You cannot die.
Is there salt left?
What have you got in your bag?
Read me first.
I borrowed money from my friends.
Have you already read this?
I should cancel my L.A. trip.
I'm beginning to regret hiring Tom.
He cannot stop him.
You can handle this.
We should follow him.
I'm as strong as before.
There's not much to be found in northern Wisconsin.
Today, I confessed my love to her. I said, "I've fallen in love with you." After that, she didn't know what to say at first. A few minutes passed until she finally said, "Things are going a little too quickly. I'd like to get to know you better first."
How did you get here?
I think Tom impressed them.
"Do you want to go to church with me, Daudi?" "No, father. I don't want to today. I'll go by myself tomorrow."
That gave us an idea.
Tom said that he was really glad Mary moved to Boston.
I put my coat on inside out.
What are you hiding from me?
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't want to go to Boston with Mary.
I don't think Tom helped Mary.
They fought for their liberty.
I can't tell you everything.
Neither Tom nor Mary knows how to do that.
We no longer need you.
Aren't I beautiful?
Can I borrow a kiss? I promise I'll give it back.
I am very sad that he has died.
Even having understood, it is a difficult theory to explain.
Is that something new?
He said he'd be back on Monday.
He said he wasn't going anywhere.
A lot has changed since then.
There's a woman waiting to see you.
Maybe you should talk to him.
My family went to the zoo to see pandas last Sunday.
You have seven sons.
Who are you?
How many people know you're alive?
I'm going to buy some bread.
I prefer staying to going.
I've finished writing the letter.
Tom reassured Mary.
I don't want to do that without the proper tools.
Would that be fair?
This is an adverb.
I can't pay the rent.
She's doing all she can, isn't she?
It turns out that you knew everything but kept quiet.
Why did you paint the bench red?
I'd buy a house if I had the money.
I don't think that Tom is trying hard enough.
Try to escape.
I'm interested in history.
What! Is this true?
The mouse ran under the bed.
You're a person.
We're very angry.
Look at it again.
When will you do that?
I'm trying to decide what to do next.
I'm going to stay for another couple of weeks.
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
He's the type of guy who doesn't take women very seriously.
I think I know where Tom is.
I haven't drunk any coffee all week.
Tom says he thinks it's a waste of time to vote.
She could not believe what she saw.
Tell me about her.
Don't argue when you are angry and don't eat when you are full.
No one knows his name.
Please show me another example.
Do you know where?
The blue lines on the maps are rivers.
She can't ride a bicycle yet.
Will you risk it?
I want to know why you haven't done that yet.
I've already told everyone that I'm moving to Australia.
Tom changed direction.
Aren't you done?
Tom was the one who did that.
I know what you are thinking.
Tom would've let you win.
Leave it to the professionals.
Will she come home at five?
You should acquaint yourself with the facts before you make a decision.
I didn't want to lose them.
Summer is the hottest season.
His new record sells well.
I have an important announcement to make.
He said that he'd be back.
I think that's a lie.
It's been stolen.
Could you send me a photo of you?
I want Tom to go to Boston to visit his uncle.
It's obviously ruined.
I told you not to go by yourself.
Don't tell a lie. Be honest.
Which one of those books did you give to Tom?
Did you tell Tom about what we did?
Where's the table?
Are you from Paris?
Tom said he didn't want to talk to you.
That's OK.
This room is very hot.
Help me, and I will help Tom.
He lives in a separate room.
He collected an entire bucket of water.
Tom and Mary went to the same school.
He didn't give me his real name.
I'm the one who broke that window.
I've finally finished writing the report.
It's for me.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
I need to think about it.
You changed it?
I used to come here.
There is one thing I look back on with regret.
Tom isn't going to sing.
Unfortunately, we must inform you that the trip was canceled.
That isn't likely to happen.
I gained two kilos this summer.
What can we do to help her?
Tom isn't afraid to die.
Why is he angry?
Mary lied to her parents.
Ants and bees are examples of industry and harmony.
You need to look at things from a different angle, it's not as catastrophic as you think.
Frogs are such marvelous creatures.
What kind of music do you usually listen to when you're driving?
Can we go?
Japanese cultured pearls have come to monopolise as much as 60% of the world pearl market.
She told me she was certain.
Go sleep in your own room.
How old is your mother?
He's intelligent.
Stand up!
We need to finish what we started.
I told you I could do it.
I see with my eyes and hear with my ears.
As a pianist, he's much better than I am.
Cows are anything but bright.
I wanted to rescue you.
Don't lose heart, Tom.
How far away are we?
Tom can do that without your help.
He's wrapped up in his studies.
If you see anybody, tell me immediately.
You could help me.
Is this seat being saved for anybody?
I'm very grateful to you for your advice.
Did you steal this?
I overslept this morning.
One of the cats is black, the other is brown.
I noticed Tom was there.
Don't forget.
I'm a born sceptic.
Tom couldn't hide his pain.
She successfully got him to tell the truth.
The dream is no longer just a dream.
It'll be very hot tomorrow.
Maybe it was them.
Why didn't you just tell me?
I've been walking for over four hours.
Sad to see you go.
Tom hacked Mary's arm off with a sword.
I'm sorry Tom wasn't able to come.
If you don't believe me, ask Tom.
Her mother is in the hospital.
Tell him the problem is solved.
My sister is younger than me.
I enjoyed talking with my girlfriend.
That's not your bicycle, is it, Tom?
It's all going to be all right.
A few glasses of wine can loosen the tongue.
The penis entered the vagina.
Just put it here.
The accident left him permanently paralyzed.
We were in Boston last summer.
Tom and I were there.
Unicorns suck.
Emily and Melanie are English.
Even children can understand this book.
No amount of alcohol could repair Tom's broken heart.
What did Tom eat for dinner?
I only know a little English.
A ball is floating down the river.
Tell me what I have to do.
I'm not sure if Tom can do that.
I would like to meet him.
I don't believe in ghosts.
The flower is yellow.
I don't need to know.
Tom's a very pessimistic person and always sees the negative side of any situation.
I think something terrible has happened to Tom.
You need an entry ticket.
Is your left leg still hurting?
Mary told me she was scared.
I would like to buy some cheese.
That's why I need to meet you.
Where did she get the eggs?
Get out of the shower!
Promise me you'll be careful.
How could anyone be so stupid?
She speaks the truth.
That's what love is.
Call me back when you find it.
We appreciate everything you have done.
Where's my coffee mug?
Tom told me to wash my hands.
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he had thought it was important.
I don't know exactly.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been notified.
I have a dog at home.
We still sing.
They do it just for the thrill of it.
Don't contradict me.
Let's have a go at it.
I love him even more now.
I'm Brazilian and I'm learning Japanese.
I didn't have much choice.
We are not going in the direction of your house.
Tom has sold several paintings.
Who can replace her?
I think Tom didn't understand the joke.
He has an eye for antiques.
There's nothing to understand in this situation.
Can you use a computer?
He is a good person.
I doubt you can do that.
You are scum.
The child caresses the cat.
Tom played a dirty trick on me.
There are numerous theories about the origin of life.
I almost drowned.
Tom does not love cheese.
He went blind.
Let's do that after school.
He was unconscious for three days.
Corporations are not people.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
She helped her husband with his work.
Do you want us to go?
My eye has swollen up.
Tom gazed at Mary.
I swear to you I didn't kill Tom.
It's going to take a while to get this done.
Call me if you find them.
This is normal in my country.
Tom is in a bad mood today.
I listen to the radio every day.
I don't think Tom will make it.
I'm certain that won't happen today.
I think Tom knows about John and Mary.
I hope you like being here.
The carburetor wasn't the problem. You needed a new fuel pump.
Have fun while you can.
I'm leaving town.
I think you're on the right track.
Tom's shy.
Tom's a klutz.
Do you still want to go?
He saw a butterfly on the wall.
We needed your help.
Tom said that you were different.
The city was overtaken by the jungle.
Who went with you?
I haven't actually said no yet.
If you eat that you will die.
I tried to talk to Tom in French.
What will people think?
There used to be a big cherry tree behind my house.
What else can you tell us?
It was stupid.
The gnarled branches scraped and grasped for me like living hands.
Tom is probably not hungry right now.
Leave immediately!
Tom didn't want to participate.
Tom took a couple of steps back.
Everyone was so busy.
Why are you telling me all of this?
Mary often speaks in riddles.
We don't know anything about you.
Tom was looking for you this morning.
Mary said she was wrong.
You're so selfish.
Don't let them drink any more.
Tom needs assistance.
It is a curse.
This is the book I want to read.
I wake up very early.
I saw Tom yesterday in a restaurant. He was talking to a girl.
Everyone left except us.
The fight is over.
This view reminds me of my home town.
The news made my hair stand on end.
What comes next?
Hm! You're right!
Do you have money?
Let's rewrite the end of the play.
I searched all over for Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
Maybe you should tell her that.
Polish is my native language.
He's a liar.
I returned to Boston on Monday.
Tom waited outside in the pouring rain for over an hour.
It wasn't this cold yesterday.
That's really odd.
My friend, sleep is important.
What happens next time?
You'll be surprised.
Don't disturb us.
Is that the only way out?
A dolphin is a kind of mammal.
She's in a good mood.
Did you pass Tom on the road?
Tom and Mary are disappointed in their son.
I was trying to talk to you.
Don't tell him anything.
Let him go home.

I don't know what you're referring to.
I didn't know you were a woman.
Tom and Mary got married a few years ago.
It looks like you've already been replaced.
She lost her money.
I think I'm going to learn a lot from you.
They don't have jobs.
I'd stay away from Tom if I were you.
You should talk to a specialist.
I know you miss them.
You need to buy new tires for your car.
Tom told me not to go into that room.
The birds settled on the branches.
You're not my friend anymore.
She said she didn't want to sing.
You've got to help Tom.
Is Tom coming?
I don't think Tom was ready.
You'll find it.
Drink it down.
Give the keys to me.
Isn't that romantic?
Do you have a large family?
Tom should apologize to you.
Teach judo to me.
Your father is in the garden.
I plan to leave today.
Internet Explorer is the world's most popular Web browser.
What did you buy?
Tom drives a Ford.
Your life's in danger.
I'm pretty sure that it won't work.
There are about forty people here.
What do you want to give Tom for his birthday?
He had to carry the bag.
They are Russian.
She's sitting on her bed.
Tom lived abroad for three years.
Don't resist.
Will you permit us to leave now?
Tom sent Mary a postcard from Rome.
Do you live with Tom?
I don't know your brother.
Are you sure it's his?
Tell her to leave.
Tom remained in Boston.
I'll be working as your assistant.
You can't see gas; it's invisible.
I had my doubts.
Some people like it.
I'm not used to doing that yet.
There isn't much wind today.
I'm going to get ice cream.
I don't want to go.
Mary is a brave girl.
She said that she wasn't very cold.
I wonder why the train is late.
You should write to Tom.
Why are you asking this?
I know you miss Tom.
Can I at least give you a hug?
May contain nuts.
It is very expensive to live here.
I don't understand why that's important.
Tom was very proud of you.
I left my key in my room.
Tom and I are still here.
Tom filled the bathtub with hot water.
He has plenty of books.
Devote your whole attention to your duties.
I don't understand why you didn't do that.
I ate a light lunch.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
They waited in line for the bus.
I don't remember when and where I met you.
Let me talk to them first.
I'm a French citizen.
What do you worry about when you go to sleep at night?
Can I go buy some ice cream?
You're in love with someone else.
Do you really love her?
Tom's rough manner frightened the children.
I didn't actually forget my camera. I just didn't want to take pictures.
Would you please keep the noise down?
You have to wait.
I'm going to look for Tom now.
You could've just told him.
I heard about what happened at school today.
I'll tell my wife.
Do you need me, Tom?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Figure it out yourself.
I'm trying to make a good first impression.
Never lose hope.
I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
You know this.
You've often said so yourself.
Is there anyone in the room?
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Have you read this morning's paper?
The clock in the church tower struck nine.
Mary told me she'd do that, but she didn't.
Grandma added an onion to the filling.
I can't believe you told her that.
I think you've had enough candy for one day.
He needs an umbrella.
I couldn't but be irritated with you.
He's worried about the result.
Did Tom tell you that he was having money problems?
Something needs to be changed.
His interests clash with mine.
I'll go by plane.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I had to agree.
Tom told Mary to wash her face.
I think that he is from Japan.
They arrived in England a week ago.
"Is this Arabic?" "No, it's Uyghur - a language that's spoken in northwestern China."
I didn't know you were back in town.
Tom knocked on the front door.
Everything was going great.
What kind of motorcycle do you have?
The train's about to leave. Hurry up.
Tom thought about it.
I bought this T-shirt on sale.
I discussed the problem with my friends.
I'm thinking about studying French.
On that day I forgot my wallet at home.
I kept the $20 I found in the street.
We just saw them.
Work began almost immediately.
The shower doesn't work.
We have a similar sense of humor.
Tom isn't having any fun.
I guess I'm a country boy at heart.
What is art?
We had to figure out how to do that on our own.
Get out of my life. I detest you.
Long live the Belarus!
I don't want you to tell Tom.
It isn't easy to find a job these days.
How long does it take to get to the beach?
Who do you think is most likely to win the race?
Tom married a rich widow.
Do you know where Tom was born?
I'm going to stay in Boston for a few days.
Oh, what is this?
Put the car in low to climb the hill.
I'll tell you an interesting story.
I'd love to go there with you.
Tom used to work as a translator.
I'll pay.
Leave it to the pros.
The finger is broken.
This is the house I used to live in.
The story doesn't end there.
Stop her!
Spiders aren't insects.
Please write the answer on this piece of paper.
Surely you don't believe that.
What's the minimum salary in Mexico?
The birds flew south.
Before the Internet, friends and lovers had to correspond.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
I always thought that Tom would become a teacher.

She'll wait for us, won't she?
Tom was wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
That's exactly what Tom wants.
Tom doesn't have many pictures of himself as a kid.
Tom and Mary said they aren't hungry.
That's all I know about her.
Were you happy?
Who do you think will win the gold medal?
The nightmare is finally over.
My sight is not as good as it used to be.
Tom is throwing up.
It was impudent of him.
My leg had to be amputated.
Is it clean?
Are you sincere?
I haven't heard from him for ages.
I wonder what inspired Tom to do that.
Tom understands French quite well.
Tom said he liked Mary.
Tom said that he didn't care what I do.
I hope you will call again.
Are you going to come back?
How long can Tom stay?
I love her from the bottom of my heart.
You're too drunk to drive.
When are we going to eat?
That's a very good car.
Tom is depending on you.
We'll change it.
China is the biggest country in Asia.
Close the door please.
You know what you did.
Did I understand that correctly?
Tom asked Mary to help him wash the car.
We really have nothing to lose.
Do you think that Tom is happy?
The cat continued to mew.
My father isn't home yet.
The owl hoots.
He said he didn't know you.
My method is surprisingly simple, but the impact is big.
Living with them isn't easy.
Tom says that's his favorite book.
Where is the Palace of Fine Arts?
Don't talk to Tom about this.
I haven't kissed Mary yet.
Tom almost always agrees with me.
It seems I've offended you.
I don't care what the doctor says: I will not give up hope that Tom will recover.
It just won't work.
Get out! I don't want to talk to you anymore!
It began to dawn.
Tom and I are both thirty years old.
We'll do that, but probably not this week.
I want you to sit here.
Leave my room immediately.
Your problem is similar to mine.
I yelled at Tom.
Is the beach near this area?
There is a map on the table.
Do we know who he is?
I must have nodded off.
Mary does that when she's sad.
Do you like SF movies?
Yes, Bob helped me.
I'm not good at math.
I can't believe we got invited.
You can go if you want.
We will catch you.
His answer is to the point.
I gave up trying to lose weight years ago.
You'd better ask Tom for permission.
If you are to succeed, you must work hard.
It is very difficult to talk about what happened.
Why didn't you go to Boston with Tom?
Why do women love presents?
You must be in good physical condition.
Who gave all this stuff to you?
The kitchen is clean.
I don't like long journeys.
The news upset me.

I wish I could buy that house cheap.
We do not know her.
Tom rescheduled.
His name is known to everyone in this town.
Tom goes to Boston a lot.

Please cancel my order and send confirmation that this has been done.
Mom is in bed with a cold.
It is very simple.
Tom drinks instant coffee.
The bridge was built by the Romans.
I'm convinced Tom didn't do anything wrong.
That bridge isn't strong enough to support so much weight.
Did you kill that man? Yes or no?
I need to see you.
That was painful to watch.
Do you really want to stay?
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
I guess so.
Please don't talk to the driver while he's driving.
It's worse than that.
They say that they hope that you win.
Tom is a well-known painter.
We slowly putrefy.
You should have called me sooner.
The parking lot is nearly empty.
Mary told me she'd never done that before.
I'm traveling alone.
I'm on duty.
I'll let Tom go.
I'll return at 6:30.
In the April we began the work.
Tom asked Mary who she thought was the best-looking guy in her class.
Who spilled the ink on the floor?

It might be a shark.
Tom decided to come with us.
He answered briefly.
I'm too late.
Don't step in the flower bed.
Butterflies are insects.
They don't know me.
Let us talk to Tom.
Put on your headphones and listen to this.
Were you close to your dad?
I wanted to impress my friends.
Her eyes darkened.
Now, tell me something about yourself.
He blew his nose in a handkerchief.
I thought you had to work.
We haven't yet learned the particulars of the accident.
Do you see any stars in the sky?
What Tom does in his free time is none of my business.
He can't stop us.
We gather here once a week.
Tom will be working at home tomorrow.
That's not what he said.
Tom must be nearly thirty.
I suggest you put that weapon down.
Don't be foolish.
We were grateful.
Tom canceled his trip.
This one is similar to that one.
He invited me personally.
I can't believe we're going to lose.
My mom says I'm pretty.
I wanted her to win.
I want to talk with you.
I didn't get fired.
I'm going to keep it.
She'd do that if she knew how.
Do Tom and Mary know why you're here?
He offered to help her.
That's why I called.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
The next question is for you.
I think that that's very important.
It would be pointless.
Why did you call me?
Didn't you know that was there?
I want to tell her I love her.
Tell him the problem is solved.
It's not serious.
I prefer to write in French.

This is really tragic.
Would you like to be rich?
Tom knew exactly what to do.
There also was another reason.
Tom is obsessed with Pokémon.
If I had taken that plane, I would be dead now.
Did you push the button?
Stick a stamp on the envelope.

Is it okay if I take a break?
Do you think Tom saw anything?
You probably shouldn't do this.

The commission has promised to take action soon.
We want to fix that.
She was born at six a.m. on July 17.

My feet are cold.
I can't sit around waiting any longer.
Did you let them drive your car?
It came on to rain toward evening.

Can you quote me a price for the house?
There's so much I need to tell you.

"What's the purpose of your visit?" "I'm a tourist."
Show it to me.
Listen to me.

Tom was surprised to see me.
I'm just kidding.
If by any chance it rains tomorrow, they will not go.

I'm not sure where to park my car.
Tom said that he was happy.
It wasn't as cheap as I thought it'd be.
There are some things you shouldn't say to Tom.
It happened three years ago.
Let's go away.
It's rarely nice weather at Easter.
I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.
When did you notice Tom was gone?
That wasn't funny.
He says he's not tired.
The mayor addressed the general public.
It doesn't matter how I found out.
You weren't invited.
I'm not going to tell you her name.
I was sure to find you here.
That's the last thing I would do.
I can't use this machine.
My bag was stolen.
Tom didn't know who it was.
Do you really love him?
Tom got in the car.
Tom bought Mary a camera.
Forget about the past. Compared to yesterday, I like today more. That's why I try to enjoy the moment, that's all.
I broke three dishes.
They don't trust me.
His feet were bare.
I've cooked you a nice hot dinner.
Where can I meet him?
Ask yourself why.
He sat at a distance from me.
Tom's cellphone vibrated on the table.
Please write your name and address.

Tom doesn't need to come.
Where's your new friend?
Where did he get this money?
He moved to Canada.
It's getting bigger.
You'll thank yourself later.
Mary heard a noise.
The room smelled of tobacco.
It is a pity you cannot come.
Do you know that crying boy?
Just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Where did you meet Tom?
I'm looking for her.
These ice cubes will melt soon.
Tom understands our system.
I don't know what Tom will say.
Tom was a very good student.
The children's area is over there.
Tom bought that car for three thousand dollars three months ago.
I haven't traveled much in these parts for a long time.
Why do you not eat raisins?
I wonder what he meant by that.

Leave your message after hearing the beep.
All of our meetings are in French.
Tom promised he would do that.
I won't be afraid.
I won't be home tonight.
We are guinea pigs.
The blue jacket fits me just right.
I want to enrol in a course.
Do you have parents?
How often do you shave?
These butterflies are rare in our country.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
How old are your parents?
Did you pass the test?
I want to help her.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
Shut the window, Jim.
Did you find out when we're supposed to be there?
They're probably already dead.
I thought that was you.
I didn't know you'd noticed.
How could you betray me like this, after all we've been through?
She's hiding something from me.
I'll be there till 2:30.
What a tragic story!
You broke it.
You did not want to answer my questions.
Tell me you're not serious!
He seems to be ill.
It was the first time I had gone abroad.
I have two sisters and one brother.
We haven't yet discussed which method is better.
Don't you have a bicycle?
He ordered me to clean the room.
They haven't left.
Did you reply to them?
Do you want beef or pork?
Mary says she's not busy.
Get out of here!
What happened in Monte Carlo happened, and what happened in Barcelona happened, and what happened in Madrid happened... and here we are. We are in Rome.
Tom's door opened.
I could answer all the questions.
He devoted much time to study.
We just want Tom to keep working.
Is Tom coming with us?
She hasn't answered me yet.
That would be a wise decision.
Are you sleeping?
I hope that we have time to prepare for that.
You are suitable for the job.
Tom published his first novel three years ago.
Tom has told me so much about you.
I'm not even sure whether Tom will come or not.
Mary sends more than a hundred text messages per day.
I think he ate about 10 oysters.
Do you know how to play the banjo?
Sheep provide us with wool.
My mother can't come.
Speak for yourself.
I am hungry.
You'd better ask her first.
I took the blame.
I've done what you've asked.
I can't talk about this.
I doubt very seriously Tom said that.
There's a grammatical mistake in that clause.
How dare you speak like that to me!
Let me help.
Tom refused to talk to Mary about John.
Tom will be back by Monday.
Humans are hateful.
When there's a will, there's a way.
We need to build a fire.
Tom hoped that Mary wouldn't win.
Where did he buy these flowers?
She always says what she thinks.
Tom likes Swiss cheese.
I'm making scrambled eggs.
Do you want me to come in with you?
How did you get your first job?
Tom didn't say anything else at that time.
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble.
She said she didn't agree.
Let's go in the other room.
Who do you know in Boston?
Please tell him we're here.
I've done that all my life.
We took a different approach.
I had been reading for an hour.
The message was for you.
Tom was taking a big risk.
Tom failed to come on time.
I thought Tom was over thirty.
Tom remembered that Mary and John had tried to kill him.
We grew up in poverty.
I don't want you to be angry.
You're much better looking than I am.
Can I sit beside you?
Don't forget to take your medicine.
We're all very proud of you.
No student was able to answer the question.
We've got to stop her.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their son.
What's the minimum salary in Japan?
Please tell me where I should change trains.
Thanks for writing so often.
Tom is wearing a suit.
Would 9 o'clock be all right?
She voted for Mr Nishioka irrespective of party lines.
What made you so mad?
I have two flowers.
I shouldn't have eaten so much.
Please help him.
Tom and Mary had to run.
Tom's aware of what's happening.
I don't read as many books as I used to.
It's pretty light.
I was born in America.
Wait until I'm done eating.
He took off his coat and put it on again.
I stayed until the end of the concert.
I fully agree with all of you.
Switch off the light. I can't get to sleep.
Here I am again.
That trip is expensive.
The guards didn't see me.
This book seems interesting.
Mary is young, but she is not innocent.
Why doesn't anybody help us?
Is anything missing?
Do you have a pass?
I spent the day reading.
No book is worth reading.
Turn on the radio, please.
How many cans of beer have you drunk?
The unthinkable happened.
Tom and Mary nodded to each other politely.
It is a lot of fun to listen to music.
I have another idea.
Tom doesn't want to eat right now.
We have to wash him.
She slept all day.
I ran ahead to warn everybody.
What's the big rush?
Their behavior changed drastically.
You have my word on it.
Does it please you?
You don't seem to be wealthy.
He is a soccer player.
You can't write "Pfirsichbäumchen"? It's so simple!
Tom said that he didn't want me to go.
Does Tom make his bed every morning?
I was born in 1988 in York.
This is the kind of music I like.
I thought it was a bad idea.
Can you sew this button on for me?
Do you have any English-Japanese dictionaries?
Why don't we take it with us?
It was the first time I had gone abroad.
Do you want to see something?
Tom is really good at math.

I intended to have called on you yesterday.
You're selfish.
Could this help?
I'm too young to go to school.
They passed notes in class.
Let's go ahead and eat.
Tom knew what Mary liked.
I ordered a salad for you, too.
I am certain that he will quit his job.
There's something Mary isn't telling us.
He makes it a rule never to speak badly of others.
Didn't anybody come?
I think Tom is pathetic.
Tom was wearing a mask.
Tom and Mary are like brother and sister.
I'm not going to help Tom.
Give me the magazine, please.
Tom and I agree.
He's dancing with another girl.
You're a good pitcher.
The process is very complicated.
We could ask him.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
How many sandwiches are there left?
Why is everyone staring at you?
Is Tom a hero or a traitor?
What would you do now?
When you returned, I had already left.
It's a thing which you use when you watch films.
Tom said Mary is a nice person.
Don't be paranoid.
May all of your wishes come true!
They sent me to kill you.
Men talk about women all the time.
Tom told us to get on the bus.
Let's start at 2:30.
Come as soon as possible.
Tom said he wanted to marry Mary.
A Mr Jones came while you were out.
I think they're working now.
Stop carping!
Call me after you talk to him.
I'm going to be there all next week.
We aren't all like that.
He asked Lincoln to say a few words.
I did it for you.
You can't stop me from thinking about it.
Stay here with her.
I don't care what you want.
I don't know why I bother.
There are a few mistakes in your report.
This is all we've got left to eat.
I don't want to tell Tom that I've been to Australia.
I'll never leave you again.
She hugged her knees.
Tom realized that he couldn't play tennis as well as Mary.
They don't speak English.
If I had had enough money, I could have bought it.
Tom and Mary are somewhere around here.
I knew you wouldn't forget them.
It's the only thing Tom can do.
Come on guys, let's get along!
I warned you not to trust her.
Is Tom with Mary?
Let's order something to eat.
I didn't know that you were Argentinian.
Tom has a knife in his hand.
Tom wants everybody to like him.
I think that's yours.
You're still wrong.
My grandfather loved reading.
The cat scared me.
Tom didn't get exactly what he wanted.
We went shopping.
Where can I find Tom now?
Something must be done!
Grab as much as you need.

Tom ingratiates himself with our new boss.
No one knows where we are.
He went to school only for a few years.
He said he'd been betrayed.
Tom said that he'd call you.
Maybe I should've told you.
Do you believe Judas betrayed Jesus Christ?
I'm not a student.

Mary promised she'd help Tom.
I am sorry to have made you wait.
I am eating a sandwich.
They said that they wanted to meet you.

The problem is we don't have enough money to complete the project.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
Call Tom and tell him to come here.
Tirana is the capital of Albania.
Australia has a diverse flora and fauna.
I don't think that Tom is married anymore.
Let's play tennis!
Why did you follow me?

I don't think that Tom knows Mary as well as I do.
These pens are better than those.
Does Tom need a lawyer?
Tom has three gorgeous daughters.
He promised that he'd come.
Mom made a cake for my birthday.
This dog saved that little girl's life.
I can't go with you next weekend, but I can the weekend after next.
He went alone.
Approximately two weeks.
Weren't you listening, Tom?
He looks half his age.
It rained that day.
Are you asleep?
How do you usually spend your weekends?
I'm allergic to your dog.
Tom is trustworthy.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
Everyone was very afraid of Tom.
I find languages fascinating.
Prices have reached a new high.
I know you have been following the situation in Algeria very closely.
It always happens the same way.
I won't need this.
I was encouraged by his words.
Have you ever noticed that Tom's right ear is much larger than his left ear?
Her explanation was unconvincing.
Why are you protesting against the government?
Tom shouldn't have said those things.
Absolutely!
Tom headed home.
Should one say "thou" or "ye"?
You're with friends.
Do you really think Tom is wrong?
I was told to help.
She attacked him with her fists.
I'm the middle child of three.
Take me to them.
Tom used a crowbar to pry open the lid of the crate.
Tom arrived just in time.
I'd rather not discuss it here.
Tom hid the knife under his pillow.
You ought to see a doctor.
Did you give it to her?
Tom comes here almost every day.
She left the room.
The two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
We expected Tom to do that.
She was truly desperate.
The hawthorn tree was tall.
These are probably yours.
When will you be back?
I was given something to drink.
I'll wait until you finish the work.
Why are you sweating?
Tom wants me to wait for him.
Do you remember his name?
I knew you'd cry.
Like it or not, you have to take this medicine.
You've got to give me more time.
What are you going to do to me?
Have you ever ridden a snowmobile?
Tom is serving a life sentence.
I slept nine hours.
His cell phone was turned off.

How much do you know about him?
He doesn't like animals.
Finally, the bell rang.
They're busy.
What else do you want to do?
My job is just as important to me as your job is to you.
You'll soon get used to living in the country.
Did Tom travel last year?
It's the third of October.
He succeeded, not because he made efforts, but because he happened to be lucky.
You can't leave me here.
We apologized to Tom.
Tom is with us.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since then.
Look at it closely.
The meat was very tender inside.
You won't mind, will you?
Mary played with her dog.
I'm fairly certain Tom doesn't believe us.
It's in a safe place.
I am not as optimistic as you are.
Tom has no enemies.
Here's the map that you were looking for.
Why do you want to stay?
Is there anything else I should know?
So what happened next?

I can't help you this week.
I want him fired.
Is this the train for London?
I am from Turkey.
We'll see her later.
My grandmother has white hair.
It's a very delicate matter.
I wonder why Tom didn't ask for my help.
The kids were playing in the schoolyard.
I'm glad to be of service.
Tom started taking his clothes off.
We were talking about them.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
Hurry up, Tom. The food is getting cold.
What does Tom do on Mondays?
I usually sleep with the window open.
The Russian language is a great thing. It seems that thing is too great for my small head!
If you don't tell her, I will.

He needs a raise.
I am reading a book about animals.

Why are you so angry with me?
If this train is delayed, we shall miss our connection at Kobe.

I really like that dress.
You should be careful with him.

I have the same trouble as you have.
I told Tom he should talk to a lawyer.
Put something on and let's leave already.
Unwittingly, he told her exactly what she wanted to know.
We need to impress them.
Tom was being polite.
Somebody's knocking at the door.
Tom? Hello? I asked you a question.
I like their pictures.
Keep an eye on the boys. They're mischievous.
Tom told me what I needed to know.
Put it down.
What chord is that?
Of all people, he deserves to be paid better.
We just have to find them.

Where did you meet him?
Mary promised me that she'd win.
His opinion is quite different from ours.
All things considered, I think we could say that the meeting was successful and met its objectives.
How soon will you be ready to leave?
Please help Tom.
He has no conscience.
After many years of reflection, I came to the conclusion that for every human, the meaning of life consists exactly in: to find the meaning of life. Each of us is a unique individual. And each of us carries in himself the capacity to find and fulfill a unique mission in his lifetime.
Tom can sleep anywhere.
Is it dangerous to take a subway alone?
I'm glad Tom will help us.

All you have to do is to clean your room.
They laughed at Tom.
Let's get this over with, once and for all.
I have to plan everything.
When I run, I get sweaty.
Tom has a beautiful wife.
This river is safe to swim in.
Tell him to go home.
I cannot take a picture of this building. It's forbidden.
It was my first job.
It is my table.
I'll keep your secret.
I'm surprised you remember us.
People can decide between me and you.
I hate being photographed.
I told you to wear a tie.
Don't tell Tom about it.
What is the password of your computer?
Tom isn't sure you'll like Mary.
I have made a careful examination of the situation.
I like tea more than coffee.
We swerved as the lorry crashed past. It was a close thing.
They were very poor.
Let's talk about that later.
Mary hurt her right foot.
Do you feel bad?
She told me she was married.
The doctor pulled the paper from his pocket.
Tom tossed his dirty clothes in the hamper.
We've been waiting for you for an hour.
You don't need to explain it to me. I already understand it.
I simply adore him.
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
Only strict adherence to the rules will prevent chaos.
I believe love exists.
I knew her very well.
What's the text about?
A cold spell gripped Europe.
Tom said that he'd go to Boston.
There was a silence.
I heard you, too.
Jim is crazy about his girlfriend.
I will give him a recipe.
He says he'll do that on Monday.
I'm just happy for Tom.
We're not open on Sunday.
I have always had faith in you.
Put your headphones on and listen to this.
A strong cup of coffee helps me wake up.
I appreciate what you've done for me.
An automobile has four wheels.
We all despise Tom.
I wasn't very busy.
I have nothing left.
When a person is tired, there's nothing better than the bathtub.
It's on its last legs.
The attempt failed.
What's on the air this evening?
I know that you can't speak French.
A stone can remain in atari until the end of the game depending on the needs of both players.
I don't want to leave a message.
I forgot to turn off the television before going to sleep.
I like this tea.
She's in the shower.
What's Tom doing there?
Anne told me that my hair was too long.
Slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world.
All of Tom's predictions came true.
They're very well.
Can you hear me, Tom?
Are you trying to kill me?
Tom is probably not hungry.
You cheated.
He hasn't answered me yet.
I am diligently studying German vocabulary.
Did you read Tom's letter?
Tom knows what I do for a living.
Elvis Presley is alive!
The ice is going to break under your weight.
I won't tell anyone about this.
Next year, hats will become fashionable.
I was there recently.
We're not students.
He doesn't drink.
Tom looked outside.
I wanted to make sure you were here.
Cool story, bro.
Tom didn't have to apologize to me.
The cat has hidden under the bench.
Tom wanted to see you.
What did Tom tell you about us?
When do you think he'll be back?
Tom was a wealthy man before he got married.
Did Tom tell you about the party tonight?
How late does the flower shop stay open?
Tom, what happened last night?
Why did you give that to Tom?
There are many beautiful parks in Boston.
Hi John! How are you?
We'll change.
I forgot about the money.
Tom bought a used car last week.
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom. That would've ruined the surprise.
Explain that to me.
I left everything there.
Could we speak to them?
The building on the mountain is our school.
Can't you decide?
Being a mom is harder than I thought.
Are you sure it's impossible?
I told Tom to leave me alone.
Doesn't it taste good?
Can you move your ears?
His mother sighed with relief.
They want to speak to you.
OK, I'll order it.
Stop that immediately.
I feel like laughing.
I left home when I was thirteen.
It's quite urgent.
Your purse is open.
I don't need a lawyer.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
I've asked him to help you.
I want you to do it alone.
Don't be surprised.
Tom is the boss now.
Why aren't you Catholic?
The girls were not afraid, but the boys were.
Would nine o'clock be convenient for Tom?
Tomorrow is Thursday.
We're sure of that.
Can you tell me about them?
Tom is more famous than Mary.
We're just pretending.
We are trying to close the box.
Tom objected to that.
Leave me out of this!
The doctor may allow her to return to work next week.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
I knew Tom and Mary were Canadians.
What will you do?
What did you want to do?
The secretary inserted the letter in the envelope.
Lift it.
Tom promised me that he'd help.
You've got to respect him.
Can you help us wash the vegetables?
I like cartoons.
No one could buy anything.
I'm younger than you.
I brought Tom home.
Are you Hungarian?
Shampoo and toothpaste are the same price.
Do you have any other pictures of Tom?
The soldier lay injured on the ground.
We'll ask politely.
Never swim while under the influence of alcohol.
All of us like Tom.
I didn't want to mislead anyone.
I've been waiting for Tom for an hour.
I cried, too.
Has Tom ever been to Australia?
Tom thinks Mary won't forget to do that.
Mary has come out of her coma.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
Tom took Mary's money.
Tom is back from the supermarket.
He's cleaning his rifle.
They watched the snow fall.
I have a job to do.
I'm not sick anymore.
Don't do two things at a time.
They have already finished the work.
Will you go with her?
I'll teach you French.
I come from Taipei.
Can I drive you home?
Won't you have some more coffee?
What's your theory?
Every time something bad happens, I get blamed.
I tried to translate the sentence "The cat says 'meow'" into five languages, but none of the translations was correct.
Have some cake.
Tom disappeared three days ago.
I swam in the lake.
Everything is OK. Don't worry.
Leave it switched on.
I want them killed.
Will you ever forgive me?
You're doing fine. Just relax. Be yourself.
I know they're hiding something.
Say goodbye to life!
"Are you finally starting to learn how to be a queen?" "Frankly, I'm not sure why I put up with you at times."
I'm related to them.
Tom didn't say a word all evening.
I thought you were coming with me.
Hang it up in the closet.
I could write Tom a note if you want me to.
I would buy them if they weren't so expensive.
How about going to a movie?
Suddenly, the captain left the ship.
These goats are extremely friendly.
I'm Tom. This is my wife, Mary.
Please promise me you won't do that.
Tom has a store in Boston.
We have to wait here.
Stop running!
It isn't so easy!
I now know why Tom didn't like me.
Tom bought some carrots.
They watch too much television.
Why do you not answer?
She saw this film ONLY once.
Stand by.
I'll drive.
I didn't ask her to go there.
It wasn't hard to understand.
They despise him.
Tom loves all his children.
Tom talked Mary into going out for coffee.
Water and oil are both liquids.
Tell them who you met today.
No need to apologize.
I can't ever forgive you for what you did.
I know I shouldn't have done that.
Tom agreed to ask Mary to do that.
Where did he go last Monday?
Why don't you go ask them?
He likes to go out fishing alone.
We took pride in our strength.
We have no school tomorrow.
Tom isn't wearing a red tie.
Nobody's forcing you to stay here.
There's a lot I want to talk to you about.
Tom is a big coward.
Tom was satisfied with the results.
I thought you were smart.
He plays very well.
You need a key to open the box.
Tom has three friends who are Canadians.
Don't forget to tell her.
I told him to come early.
What would you like to order?
Do you want to hear the truth?
Tom is a fanatic.
Tom didn't know what to do.
Let me give this to you before I forget.
Tell me where he is.
Tom is a tough cookie.
It was awfully strange.
You must have thought of something.
I was tired and so was everybody else.
Tom is hoping you'll do it.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since 2013.
She is less beautiful than her sister.
Tom is an able cricket player.
I can run as fast.
I know you're the boss.
You may begin.
Tom has at least 300 books.
It needs washing.
I want to study abroad, even if my parents are against it.
Tom is Mary's only grandchild.
I get a haircut every month.
Be polite and respect others.
It was time for lunch.
I want it back.
Nobody volunteered.
Did you really talk to her?
The baby is stuck. A caesarian section is necessary.
Tom told Mary she had no choice.
I met him at the airport.
Tom asked us not to laugh.
Do you want to be beautiful?
Please tell me this is a joke.
The ones that don't make noise are dangerous.
The gate was unlocked.
Tom will obey you.
I told Tom you'd want to do that.
Tom left the front door open.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I can teach you how to cook.
Tom doesn't know why Mary didn't win.
I walked alone.
I would really like to explore this cave.
That's done.
Tom did it the way I told him to.
At any rate, I can go out when it stops raining.
Tom touched Mary's shoulder.
Tom was standing just in front of a large building that was up for sale.
We're reading.
It was just your imagination.
I've spent my whole life in Boston.
Tom asked me to protect you.
The teachers are trying to motivate their students.
I bought this pair of shoes, but they are a bit too small.
We need evidence.
Please send me another copy.
Now, we can only trust God.
Tom used to tell me everything.
Here is your key.
I don't know any French.
The gentleman was standing in front of the bank.
Write your name and address on this envelope.
Tom is putting his shoes on.
My wisdom teeth are coming through.
How big of an idiot are you?
Let's keep our classroom clean.
I think about you often.
Tom is a dependable man.
What did you miss?
Tom got angry and left.
I was a fool. I'm sorry.
The woman awakens.
She no longer trusts him.
You must talk to them.
Did you take these pictures in Australia?
"What were their names?" "Why do you care?"
If you tell your teacher you lost your homework, she won't believe you.
Tom appointed her as manager.
They were saying something in Japanese.
I've heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
There was a report from the neighbours because a drunkard was making noise in the park. When the police officers arrived at the scene, Kusanagi was alone, dead drunk and completely naked.
Tom didn't want to leave, and neither did I.
I know.
You look angry.
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek.
I still believe it.
Tom is about to leave.

Tom liked Australia.
We keep the right to refuse to use the image you suggested if we consider it is inappropriate.
I have trouble remembering names.

Can you buy a ticket for me?
I don't think Tom was happy.
She said she felt the same.
Tom left Mary a message.
You arrived on time.
Is there a treatment?
You've frightened him.
I gave him a ride.
Watch carefully.
Tom forgot to close the window.
He did a cartwheel.
Tom will sell his house.
Aren't you insured?
I'm gay, so?
Why did Tom let you in the house?
Tom screamed something in French.
Have you been drinking today?
We have a test tomorrow.
I need this one.
She adored him.
We watched the baby snuggling with her teddy bear.
A good idea occurred to me just then.
I don't want to disturb her.
Why do you think Tom likes it?
You work like you eat.
You broke my cup.
This procedure has advantages and disadvantages.
I'll take the more expensive ones.
The circus is in town.
Call me Tom.
Tom has betrayed you.
When do you plan on getting married?
Are you so sure it is a coincidence?
The table is wobbling.
Someone's humming.
What's your greatest fear?
How often do you eat chocolate?
Tom thinks that Mary is guilty.
He's a nerd.
I didn't show them anything.
I want you to try it.
Screw them!
Can you stay with them?
Tom and Mary can't do it all by themselves.
The arrow pierced the thick board.
Keep an eye on her.
Do you have any free time this weekend?
Unfortunately, many Russian citizens have inadequate conception of what is happening in Kyiv.

I'll go tell Tom.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
He had no food.
I can manage.
I am writing this letter to my wife.
You should've stayed in Boston longer.
Where is the school?
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
Why would you want to leave?
I'm much more experienced than you are.
Tom recognized Mary's dog.
Tom doesn't care.
Ask her.
He is alone.
You seem like a smart person.

Tom goes there every morning.
Do you know Chinese?
I closed the door behind us.

Can you speak Low German?
Could you stay and help me?
We're competitive.
I'm going there now.
Let's keep in touch.
Are you married to Tom?
I think you know that.
We were born on the same day.
Tom is sitting next to his brother.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.

Cut them with a knife.
Something's bothering them.

Why do you like it?

It was sunny this morning.
This was unexpected.

What are you having? It smells delicious.
I'm sure Tom won't be finished doing that.
I sleep on my stomach.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
I'm sorry, Tom. I don't approve of your methods.
The toilet is on the left.
We all die.
I knew about this three weeks ago.

I'd like for Tom to tell you who he was with on Saturday night.
I live in Dublin right now.

I cannot accept your present.
Sometimes reality and fantasy are hard to distinguish.

Tom wasn't at home, was he?
I work fast.
She suffers from a chronic malady.
Do you mean to see Tom before you go?
Mary was there, but she didn't help us.
I'm trying to be brave.
Little did I realise how much I loved her.
I'm going to be lonely without you.
Who are you referring to?
Tom checked the answering machine for messages.
Where exactly did you put it?
Tom speaks French very fluently.
Tom isn't going to give an inch.
Who's in the living room?
You must face the facts.
It's not enough.

I've been expecting something like that.
I thought Tom and Mary were twins.
There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

Sleep is necessary for good health.

"We need to get rid of the body," said Tom.

I wonder why nobody told me.
I have other symptoms.
My father is sick.
She said she'd come.
It's a trap.
Rainy days make me unhappy.
That's exactly what he said.
Tell me the reason why Tom was fired.
Mary had found her very own Prince Charming.
We often go there.
He has a big mouth.
We'll help you do that.
You never told me that.
How beautiful the valleys are in spring!

Italians eat pasta.
Tell her to help me.

The street was empty of people and traffic.
Do you want it now?
Do you have a cellphone?
You'd better ask Tom yourself.
I have to set an example.

Tell them to help us.
You could've called me yourself.
What did you open it with?

Lie on your stomach.

Stop going there.
Maria used this table.
Everyone knows Tom is lying.
Her cheeks flamed up.

Why do you always seem to want to argue?
I love you.
He is bound to pass the test.
I was bored with his old jokes.
Stop there.
"I think I understood everything," Tom said, "but I'm not absolutely sure."
You should've kept that a secret.
Do you cry often?
It's doubtful if Tom can win.
Why were you late this morning?
I didn't expect you to do that.
You need to be aggressive.
I see him quite often.
This makes her angry.
Thanks for the update.
Tom is an amazing person.
"This came for you." "Urgh..." "So hey, you remember that one that she sent you where she asked you to get her those pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yeah." "And then she told you to write a critique on Mac's physical appearance." "Yeah." "Then she sent the critique to Mac." "...Yeah." "What did you tell her you learned from that?" "I found that a Phillips screwdriver is persuasive, but not seductive; and also Rarity charges up the butt for stuff I really think she should do as a friend."
This question is difficult to answer.
Tom didn't even know Mary had left.
You're giving me the same old line.
Tom wasn't wet.
Biologists released some turtles into the sea.
Please don't let Tom drive.
I'd rather wait here.
I leave it up to you.
There are mushrooms, but I don't want any.
It was big.
A lot of companies have pared their staff down to a minimum.

Two years went by before I could find a good job.

It all ended very badly.
I noticed that, too.
They asked what they could do to help.

He could have done it.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.

He heard somebody say his name.
Please wash this shirt.
Please tell Tom to close the windows.
She felt herself being lifted up.
Why did you go to the airport?
Tom and Mary are going to be fired if they do that again.
I think Tom was only joking.
The wedding will be held in a 17th century church.
He's not useful to us anymore.
It is an endangered species.
I'm sure you deserved it.
January is my month.
I drive very fast.
I found the person who did that.

You could at least take a shower.
Who cares if Tom doesn't win?
How many rooms has your flat got?
Do you want me to take you home?
I can hire you in my company.
Are you sure that Tom doesn't live here?
You're going to be a grandmother.
Tom's easily offended.
Why don't you ask him to do it?
I saw you looking at her.
Were you sick?
I've known Tom for three years.
You may come at any time tomorrow afternoon.
Airplanes have taken the place of electric trains.
He is as tall as I.
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
Perhaps we'll meet again.
We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide.

"Do you have any siblings?" "No, I'm an only child."
I read a lot of books last summer.
Imagine if you started hiccoughing and you couldn't stop.
The fighting there lasted several days.
The problem is me.
The meeting finished thirty minutes ago.

Even a child can understand that.
Shall I give you something to read?
