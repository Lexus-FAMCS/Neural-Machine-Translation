I see you are ready.
I want the fan.
Tom did a handstand on the beach.
You should go.
I have been to America twice.
I wrote a letter to my mother.
My car is being repaired.
I flew above the clouds.
The economic situation grew worse.
Did you hear that, Mike?
We've got to call them.
That's lovely.
I always try to be fair.
That which the Russians can only laugh at, the Europeans can take seriously.
Do you like pretzels?
We'll wait.
You're too laid back.
Cut!
Nobody can help them.
I want to go outside.
We'll start as soon as it stops raining.
Which do you like better, rock music or classical music?
As for me, I'm a rather simple person.
You didn't eat much lunch.
She's here since five o'clock.
Don't get taken in by their advertising; I don't see how they can sell something like that for that price.
Couldn't you help me first?
He was disappointed.
I've brought you a gift.
Can you confirm that?
Didn't you know that I could speak French?
Where did Tom get those old coins?
Tom doesn't like it here.
Why are you so arrogant?
You've been gone for so many years.
I'd like to know the phone number of the nearest American Express office.
I've lost my dignity.
Both Tom and I speak French.
The two came to the same conclusion.
Learn from others' mistakes.
Everyone would like to believe that dreams can come true.
I wasn't expecting any of this.
I saw you on TV.
He knew he wouldn't be replaced.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
I just want to see your smile, that's all.
If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
Tom wasn't fired last week. He was fired three weeks ago.
My car is here.
He did his best but soon saw that he could not compete with such a fast runner.
The plural form of 'person' is 'people', not 'persons'.
Feel free to stay.
Your friend Tom hasn't returned.
What is it that you liked about him?
I won't do that. I'd rather die.
Can anyone tell me the time?
I have a low tolerance for pain.
Do you think we'll get a chance to rub shoulders with any celebrities?
You should tell the truth.
They are all very busy.
He has no less than twelve children.
Tom found himself bewildered.
Do you dream about me?
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
My mother cooks well.
Can someone call security?
You will prevail.
What was Tom doing in Boston?
I think I hurt his feelings.
Tom nodded his approval.
Karen bought a lot of things at the flea market.
Tom knows Mary won't do what John asked her to do.
Tom graduated from the same school as Mary.
We were late because of you.
I love you like a son.
I don't get up as early as my mother.
I went to bed as soon as I got home.
I hope you can join us.
Thank you for your help.
Tom was young and impressionable.
Will it ever stop raining?
Cities differ from one another.
You're brave.
I am afraid they both have a bad reputation.
You promised that you wouldn't drink today.
A person usually has two reasons for doing something: a good reason and the real reason.
Tom hated all of us.
You forgot to wake Tom up, didn't you?
This should take about thirty minutes.
That was my fault.
I think you have a fever.
Go and ask Tom.
I'd ask Tom.
She loves him now more than she did before.
Kim is living with Ken.
He shouted, "Get out!"
Tom is the only Canadian in our class.
You can't stop people from talking.
They put a fence around the garden.
He isn't smart enough to add up numbers in his head.
He does not know how to behave at the table.
I won't fail this time.
To be bored is a sin.
Want to see a magic trick?
That's not easy.
Look at it again.
Are you from Kyoto?
They exchanged a look.
You know Boston pretty well, don't you?
He was speaking.
Does Tom always act like this?
Tom made Mary happy.
Take that off your head.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
You must come.
Just say what you want to say.
Tom has dyed his hair black.
Tom is uninterested.
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework.
My wish has finally come true.
Come with me. There's something I want to show you.
I'm about to go out.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Tom seemed tired this evening.
What language do you usually speak?
Decide how much you want.
I haven't received any messages.
German is the only world language that capitalizes all nouns.
I knew Tom very well.
Why did you hang up?
I'm going to be asked to do that again, I'm sure.
Tom tried to help me.
We had a few problems ourselves.
I thought you were going to talk with Tom.
Have you been here all day?
What can Tom and Mary do about that?
Music has charms to soothe a savage breast.
I was born at a very young age.
Do you want to be with me or not?
Does that make you feel better?
He is, so to speak, a walking dictionary.
"Whose books are these?" "They are Alice's."
I've never really thought about having children.
Do you know Tom's brother?
Tom wanted to be a teacher.
We're now alone.
Tom looked as if he hadn't eaten anything in a long time.
What have you heard?
He's presenting his papers to the police.
Tom needs to gain weight.
Are you sure you don't know what this is?
Did you miss Greece when you went to Germany?
That's the best textbook.
Have my piece of cake if you like.
I wish I were a robot.
Tom didn't do it, did he?
Didn't you know that Tom had a house on Park Street?
OK, I'll buy a car tomorrow!
I bought this TV from Tom.
If I had bought the painting then, I would be rich now.
Tell me the reason why she got angry.
I didn't know you were upset.
Let it be.
Tom picked up the dice and threw them.
I'm not proud of it.
We all want a new car or a new phone.
Can you speak slowly?
I gave it to her yesterday.
That's one of my favorite expressions.
I don't know how old I am.
Tom is approximately the same age as me.
The bread is stuffed with cheese.
You are victors!
This offer is very interesting.
All of my siblings are taller than me.
It's what we deserve.
We proved Tom wrong.
No one knows their name.
I used to have that same problem.
Smoke detectors should be fixed to the ceiling.
Suddenly, a good idea occurred to me.
Don't blame Tom.
That hotel was good and inexpensive.
Where are we headed?
Did you vote for Tom?
I'll take the yellow one.
His grandfather is what is called a self-made man.
Double the dose.
You have a very good voice.
I am not the person I used to be.
Did he come by bus or by train?
I don't think Tom even saw me.
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
Whatever happens, don't say my name.
I know what's going to happen next.
This is extremely confidential.
There's another possibility.
I thought Mary was Tom's girlfriend.
Tom is working fast.
She may have been surprised when she received my letter.
You forgot to put on your tie.
Tom has a hard-to-pronounce last name.
I'm sure you deserved it.
I won't tell you how to do that.
Don't listen to that man.
I had never seen Tom cry.
Did you suggest that to them?
This medicine will cure you of your skin disease.
We can't afford mistakes.
It's never too late to say no.
I wanna love you forever!
The same thing almost happened to me.
This is too expensive.
I want to give you a gift.
I really want to go home.
When spring comes, the days get longer day by day.
Tom always says hi to his neighbors.
We talked about that on the way home.
Wasn't it enough?
The castle has been restored and is open to the public.
These boots have seen plenty of service.
I wonder what made Tom think Mary doesn't have to do that.
My mother is active.
We no longer have the power to resist.
It seemed that there was no one in the village.
I had to do that before 2:30.
Where did Tom go yesterday?
You and I both know that that's not going to happen.
So what's your problem?
I don't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
You say one thing and then act just the opposite.
Are you lying?
The plants need watering.
Where is Paris?
I'd better go look for her.
I was concerned for obvious reasons.
Do you have any siblings?
This base is now under our control.
This place is fantastic.
I'm not offended.
I don't understand why that is important.
She wanted to see him.
I don't think that I need to do anything else.
Tom was safe.
That's what managers are supposed to do.
You must respond at once to the letter.
It's now time to take action.
I'll go and get you something to eat.
She's not here right now.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of becoming a star like Seiko Matsuda.
I hate the laws.
No one's blaming you.
The milk's a bit off.
I don't know what you want to do.
Tom won the contest last year.
You all need Tom.
Tom called Mary stupid.
Are you going by bus or car?
Who did Tom play with?
Same sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries worldwide, including Ireland as of yesterday.
You're fat enough as it is.
I've searched everywhere.
What sport do you like best?
Tom wasn't wearing shoes.
Have you already told Tom?
Obey your parents.
I wish that my French was as good as your English.
I told Tom not to date Mary.
You looked like you were jealous.
He trusted me.
He fell off his bicycle.
You're as guilty as him.
Tom is a talented musician.
You look fabulous.
This is anything but easy.
I know you were the one who did that.
Can you trust Tom?
Play there.
I've learned to live with the pain in my back.
Yesterday?
Christ is the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
The door finally opened.
She fell down the ladder.
I like this sweater. I think I'll buy it.
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.

Tom has changed.
We're not going to change anything.

The elevator is coming up.
I'll remember you forever.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
If it doesn't work, throw it away.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
I had to do everything alone.
They won't find anything.
She said she didn't mind waiting.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and fled to the window.
That made us angry.
Tom needs to be quieter.
How did you find Tom?
The table was loaded with fruit.
My father forbids my having a dog.
How long have you lived in Japan?
Since when have you been waiting? Have you been waiting a long time?
Don't talk to him about it.
Everyone wants you to do that.
Tom told everyone he wanted to become a barber.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
All of us like them.
We didn't have time to do that.
I thought I told you never to go there alone.
You're going to get us both killed.
I never thought we couldn't do that.
Way to go!
Tom wrote a very profound report.
Infect the area with cholera.
Her voice is pleasant to listen to.
The center of the universe is at every point in the universe.
I'm looking for my cat.
Too much money?
You like soccer, don't you?
You seem very nervous this morning.
Tom never wrote to me.
It's said that the mayor is on the take.
The dumb masses believe that Mandela was a decent man.
Finding Tom won't be difficult.
How much is this book?
They speak German fluently.
No one came except Mary.
I thought Tom was dead.
Congratulations to you both.
I suppose I shouldn't have said that.
Mary wanted to finish making breakfast before Tom woke up.
She said she would do that for us.
He loves sunsets.
Someone locked me in the room.
Twitter is among the biggest enemies of Islam.
I have a few questions for both of you.
Put the broom in the closet.
Don't be insulted.
He arrived at an important juncture in his life.
Mary knows her.
Let's wait until tonight.
Tom told me Mary was very hungry.
Is she right?
Why don't you give me a call later?
Tom lives near you, doesn't he?
I told you to stay in the house.
I am dying for a cold drink.
I'm impressed with your French.
Now I'm in trouble.
You can talk to me.
You can't go there by yourself.
What you say is right.
I followed the rules.
I have some property in Boston.
That doesn't mean anything anymore.
I see the sun setting every day.
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow.
I'm a self-supporting student so I can't have that sort of high class thing.
Tom told me not to tell anyone.
Don't smoke here.
Tom and Mary built a sand castle on the beach.
Are you hiding something?
It seems Tom can't speak French.
The teacher cannot have said such a thing.
Tom admitted that he didn't know what to do.
There is a war raging.
How do you like it?
May I call on you some day?
Jam comes in jars.
This animal is very clever.
I need to borrow your car for a few hours.
My advice wasn't followed.

Will we arrive on time?
Tom handed me a sandwich.
What does that refer to?

I've caught a cold.
I hate broccoli.
You'll like her.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
I'll keep that book for myself.
Tom collected his things and left the room.
She needed them.

A bore is a person who talks when you wish him to listen.
Please get me out of here.
Tom has just opened a restaurant on Park Street.
I apologized to Tom for what I did.
I asked you to leave us alone.
Christianity has many followers.
It's no use asking him for help.
I just want to know why.
It looks fascinating.

They're boys.
I can't understand the meaning of this word.
It'll cost at least a hundred pesos.
Tom kissed her on both cheeks.
I suppose you have the right to know.

The children like to eat ice cream.
He did all he could.

Hey Susan, how are things?
You'll never guess who I saw this morning.

Lucky you!
She earns her living by teaching.
We don't have the money.
Where's Tom's assistant?
Tom has visited Australia three times.
Don't search for logic behind it.
Tom doesn't have any idea what Mary is thinking.
Leave it there.
I don't like to draw.
She does it faster than you.
I know I deserve this.
Tom sat reading.
Please sign here.
What the woman wants, God wants!
Tom lent me three books.
Why is Tom's name not on the list?
This time is different.
That's a good sign.
He said that he wasn't at home.
This is not a fair act.

We plunged into the river.
You've betrayed us again.
When did you buy it?
The doctor gave her four stitches.
You are drunk!
You must have me confused with somebody else.

There are no flowers growing on Mars.
This is the first time I've ever attended these kind of meetings.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary treats him.
Are you staying, Tom?
We can't lie to him.
I think that she is from Italy.
I'm used to this kind of thing happening.
I visit him often.
Let's discuss this at another time.
I told him to wait for me.
They're amazing.

Don't go in that building.
Do it for Tom and me.

Every second counted.
I asked Tom not to bother us.
I don't think he's going to hear us.
I don't know where you're going.
Let go of me!
Tom seemed glad to see us again.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
Why did you have to go?
I liked the third song you sang last night.
Everyone looked at her.
He's probably telling the truth.
Do you need anything else?
They're coming.
We have a lot of good restaurants here in Boston.
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
I'm very worried about the kids.
Do you know where we can find Tom?
Mary whistled.
I'm expecting you to do that.
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
Do you still live where you used to live?
It wasn't me that wrote that message.
I feel lethargic.
He'll come home soon.
Tom's cat is fighting with Mary's cat.
How can I make him like me?
Fry us some eggs.
I've been in Australia for over a year.

Don't complain!
Tom went completely insane.
None of your business.
They're useless.
That helps sometimes.

You agree with Tom, don't you?
You have three choices.
Where will you stay in Boston?
My sweater is purple.
Tom must be up to something.
How did you get in my house?
This is a dream dictionary.

I don't speak French either.
They look worried.
When was the last time you used this dictionary?

Look at that photograph.
I always knew this could happen.
That boy is very clever.
I didn't follow her to the end.

Gosh, I'm 25 years old now. Isn't that horrible? Rounding up, I'm 30!
I wouldn't count on it.
We were lucky to find our keys.
Didn't Tom tell you anything about me?
Maybe Tom will change his mind.
Can I play with you?
I no longer need a mother.
That's all we needed!
Tom won't sign it.
Bring me some water.
"Who's this man?" "That's not a man. It's a robot I thought up!"
Tom wasn't worried about his grades.
I was just about to do that.
How was the math test?
Is Tom planning to do that today?
Would you please speak a little bit more slowly?

Did you clean your room?
One cannot live here.

I'm my own boss.
When are you going to tell them?
Enough for one day.

I don't understand what she wants me to do.
I handed the mike to him.
He loves to party.
I loved you from the first moment I saw you.
Everybody looked bad.
You're illiterate.
I know your type.
Why don't you go with me?

Did Tom come here yesterday?
Tom has a very stressful job.
Tom, Mary and John sat around the kitchen table.
He jumped into water without removing his clothes.

If you've got something to say, just say it.
Do you have a Facebook account?
It's really wonderful seeing you again, Momoe.
Tell Mary that I'm proud of her.
I wasn't able to get my car started.
It must have been difficult for Tom to do that.
I brought that back from Australia.
Do you want to know what the problem is?
Did you talk to them?
I want you to do that right now.
Their job is done.
That's the person I told you about yesterday.
As I was having lunch, the phone rang.

Brexit means Brexit.
There are many sights to see in Kyoto.

Tom has left me.
I didn't know that Tom's car was stolen.
We must stop them.
You can let her go.
Tom must've been there.
Tom came to the party with a girl half his age.
Do you know when this shop closes?

No one was listening to you.
What an unfortunate coincidence!
If you don't talk louder, he won't be able to hear you.
You have to share the cake equally.
He dropped a vase.
Don't look at him.
Tom already knows what happened to Mary.
I have three chickens in my house.
You're being hunted.
If she annoys you, I'm going to ask her to leave.

There are rules.
I didn't know Tom was tired.
Tom says that's his favorite store.
This man is Chinese.

The police are looking for us.
Tom kissed Mary back.
Did you buy the pomegranate juice?
Tom cannot drive a car.
Press this button in case of emergency.

He's proud of his sons.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
Can ostriches fly?
Don't be late for school.

You've done a very good job.
Two small bottles, please.

I arrived after Tom had left.
He said good-bye for good.
Is it dirty?
Tom eats alone in front of his computer.
Where does she want to go?
Don't tell me what I can't do.
He came down with a cold.
I've always loved learning languages.
We don't sell beer.
That's just superstition.

It must've cost a fortune.
I want to sleep.
I came back to help you.
He is a very thoughtful person.
I'm just going to assume Tom will be here.
I voted against you.
I have to go talk to the manager.
You can come in.
Wait here till I come back.

Every day is a gift.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
She was arrested by the police.

Tell me again what time you expect me to be there.
My accent is probably strange.
That's always a good sign.
It looks like Tom is in love.
I have searched everywhere, but I could not find it.
That really put me on the spot.
Tom has no idea where Mary lives.
Can I go to work?

You could ask him.
Why is Tom still single?
Drops dripped.
He failed in the examination because he had not studied.
My grandmother is still very active at eighty-five.
Tom knows Mary was here.
Don't talk about them.

Mary was dressed all in white.
Tom and I met three years ago.
I didn't want to wait.

Thank you for lunch!
You aren't like the others.
That furniture is my mother's.
Talk to my lawyer.
Don't ask me what Tom is going to do.
My mother had been cooking supper for two hours when I got home.
I thought you loved him.
That is your only flaw.
We gather together every Friday.

Horses run fast.
Just ignore what Tom said.
We can help her now.

It is interesting that no one noticed that mistake.
What's Tom looking at?

She broke a glass.
Is that your mother?
Why don't you go help them?

Animals cannot exist without air and water.
Do you like China?
Don't work too hard!
The first step is always the hardest.
Everyone looked at me.
Instead of going to Boston next summer, let's go to Chicago.
Maybe she died with a falafel in her hands.
I want you to be better.
You've got to warn me.
Tell her to do the same.
I've made a mistake in my calculations.
Tom doesn't like yogurt.
I want your opinion.
Fresh flowers are always present in my home.

His sacrifice will not be in vain.
Tell them no.
Wow, you're so lucky!
He is an early riser.
Tom told the police everything that he knew.
I'll visit soon.
Don't open the door for anyone.
Tom is on a diet.
Let him sleep.
I want you all to know I'll never change.
Did you get permission to do that?
To tell the truth, this matter does not concern her at all.
There is nobody better than you.
Mary knew that she'd win.
Tom looked a bit nervous.
Tom started screaming at Mary.
You were right, too.
Tom can't decide.
He wanted to buy a new jacket.
Stay in this room.
Take all of these boxes outside.
I hear that his father is abroad.
I have to take these books back to the library.
I thought you said you knew how to speak French.
Mary's parents are very permissive.
I should've told Tom to go there.
We should hire him.
We'll talk with Tom today.
I'll never work for you.
You haven't yet paid me.
What just happened there?
Let's get inside.
When should I do that?
What do you know about me, exactly?
It's the rainy season in Japan right now.
Your birthday is coming soon.
She roasted the turkey.
You're the expert.
It's hard to surprise me.
Let's go tell the others.
Where can I put my bag?
They're moving away.
I told him I wouldn't do it.
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Tom doesn't know he's supposed to do that.
Tom brushed the snow off his boots.
I'm glad I ran into you.
She trembled with fear.
Are you young?
Tom watched the squirrels play.
Tell me, briefly, what happened.
Tom went to Boston in October.
Let them stay there.
Give me a little space.
This is the reason I came here.
I know you want to see them.
You don't look like Tom.
My father used to take me here when I was young­.
Tom and I are soul mates.
We drank all night.
Tom lumbered along like an elephant.
I groped around in the dark for my flashlight.
I don't know very much about Tom.
Physics is a fundamental natural science.
You're way younger than me.
Hey, Tom, are you here?
This dictionary isn't mine.
He hasn't left his room all day.
Tom didn't say anything worthwhile.
It's for the children.
Tom would tell me.
Sales are dropping, and it’s most likely happening due to an increase in competition.
Three voted against the idea.
What's Germany's largest lake?
I'm going to go find them.
I have work for him.
Are you sure you're okay?
Do not accept the world as it is.
Tom visited Australia.
Yesterday I met Marie.
They'll understand that.
They are all busy.
That seems suspicious.
Tom tried to return the swimsuit for a larger size, but the clerk told him that wasn't allowed.
Emily is an Australian citizen.
I just ignore them.
Come and help.
Why are you lying?
The police caught Tom.
Mary can do the splits.
My parents are quarrelling.
I'm nothing like Tom.
Tom allowed me to do it.
How are you going to tell him?
Let's go there today.
How will I find it?
Tom said that it was raining.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
The car wasn't making that noise before.
Tom doesn't know how to read music.
Do you need any money?
We don't have enough money to buy everything we need.
I can't decide whether to do that or not.
She said she wanted to talk to you.
I did my duty.
Tom found my bike.
Tom didn't realize what was happening.
Tom told me he wanted to visit Mary in Boston.
What has actually happened here?
She died on a cold night in December.
So what are you saying, he's an artist?
"Remember your promise!" "Don't worry! I can keep a secret!"
Why did you say yes if you didn't want to go?
You're a disgrace to this family!
Tom knows the terminology.
Maybe you should talk to him.
Did you sleep with that woman?
Are Tom and Mary working together?
I want you to know all this.
I tried to stop her.
He left his umbrella in the bus.
I was bored to death.
He does that.
How long does it take to get to Vienna on foot?
I insist that I'm innocent.
What Tom said wasn't correct.
I want to keep one.
Were you able to talk to them?
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
We need a little time alone.
We all agreed.
Tom has promised never to do that.
That won't solve our problem.
You have a dog, don't you?
I think that it's not necessary to do that.
Neither Tom nor Mary know how to speak French.
You need my permission.
Did you go to Boston with Tom?
They call me Bob.
I'll spend the night here.
I could hardly make out half of what she'd said, she was hurrying to share the obtained information. I had to listen twice.
Didn't you know Tom and I often sing together?
The clock has just struck three.
What do your sisters do?
Tom wants us to suffer.
She just wanted to have fun.
I carefully took down everything that my teacher said.
Who told you that you could come?
I'll ask my father for money.
We can beat them.
Tom is going blind.
My boyfriend is possessive.
I don't want to think about it.
"Your cheek's bleeding! What happened?" "Well, my shaver broke! Then I used a razor and ended up nicking myself."
Where can I find them?
We were very close.
Is your father a doctor?
I've got to see it.
Everybody hates us.
I sometimes find it hard to express my feelings.
It isn't that windy today.
Do you know whose snowboard this is?
Sometimes you surprise me.
Could you speak more slowly, please?
There's no magic bullet.
You were dropped on head as a child.
You drink milk, don't you?
Almost all girls are kind.
Someone is watching them.
I don't know how Tom died.
Do I have to do that, too?
I suspect Tom won't want to do that tomorrow.
We ate sandwiches for breakfast.
I like your idea.
Nobody saw them steal the book.
Warm me up.
He said that English was his maternal language, but his accent was a dead giveaway.
We can't fish there anymore.
What time was your appointment?
They refused to disclose the location of the hostages.
I forgot to tell Tom.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
I am very sensitive to the cold.
He didn't speak to me for several days.
It will grow back.
Why would she say no?
Jim is not what he was.
You don't even like fish.
Put yourself in my shoes. What would you have done?
Of course I can drive a car very well.
I will get married this year.
You were Tom's only friend.
That's not funny.
Tom wants to know how much ice cream Mary ate.
Tom knows where I work.
Tom didn't know why Mary was late.
Mary handed Tom her keys.
Tom has nothing to apologize for.
You seem confused.
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
How are we going to get in?
Tom wants someone to close the window.
Tom never even saw Mary.
Did anyone see you come in here?
Tom should go home now.
Our television stopped working yesterday.
Tom doesn't like basketball.
Tom refused to even consider my suggestion.
I think that you have my umbrella.
I don't want him to worry.
We moved to Boston when I was three.
Tom always gets what he wants.
They didn't find anything.
My father often falls asleep while watching television.
My left arm is asleep.
Is it serious, Doctor?
I tried to cheer Tom up.
I heard that Tom got married to a rich woman.
Call the fire department!
Tom lives a floor up from me.
Are you still on a diet?
There's still plenty of time.
He dressed up as a woman.
Just give it to him.
I won't let you do it.
This convenience store is open 24/7.
The house where Tom lives is in the old part of the city.
Tom just wants to show off.
What else will you be doing this summer?
I closed the trunk.
Let's buy her one.
The car turned right when it reached the corner.
You wouldn't do this if Tom were here.
Don't just stand there; do something!
I continued reading the book.
Tom gave Mary the bad news.
To love life means to live well.
I don't want to talk to Tom anymore.
The dog is black.
What kind of music do you like?
It took slightly more than five minutes for Tom to read the pamphlet.
What are you doing tonight?
So long, have a good time.
It cost me a lot of money to build a new house.
I think Tom is too aggressive.
Tom checked the answering machine for messages.
I put my hand on Tom's shoulder.
You fainted.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
Where is the nearest metro station?
Tom heard me sing.
That happened three months ago.
I didn't know Tom was sleeping.
Drink your milk!
I don't like the idea of working on the weekends.
Do you like red wine?
Tom kept shoveling.
How often do you get your hair cut?
Tom is rich and famous.
I was barefoot.
I told Tom I couldn't do that.
It looks like Tom is going to cry.
It's not bad here.
Take it easy, Tom.
You're quite an artist.
Someone broke into my office and stole some important documents.
We know that we're going to lose.
A cat came out from under the desk.
Do you have any French wine?
Tom is leaving tomorrow morning.
Tom called his friends over.

The TV isn't plugged in.
Did you fix it?
She looked like an angel.
Aren't you ashamed of the way you behaved?

You're back.
He has three elder sisters.
I'm all for that.
I hope it's enough.
Go find somebody who can help.
Thanks for taking me fishing.
What's that bird?
I don't regret anything either.
You look smashing.
This debate is silly.
I'm sure that Tom will come tomorrow.
It doesn't count. You didn't know.
I've already told everyone that I'm moving to Australia.
Do you see her anywhere?
This is how I got acquainted with them.
Washington's army has captured Trenton.
I don't think that I can do that now.
I'll explain afterwards.
She removed the papers from the desk.
The price of the carpet is determined by three factors.
You were snoring last night.
You're just running away from life's problems.

Tom is a very shy boy.
I can't see them.
When are you going to have another baby?
I drink coffee every day.
I hope Tom doesn't do it again.
Why did Tom buy it?
Excuse me, I'm coming through.
I had to try to convince Tom.
Tell them we're here.
It wasn't easy for me to do that.
I can't buy everything we need.
Each one of us was given three hundred dollars.
Tom is convinced that the earth is flat.
Tom was beaten to death with a golf club.
I wonder whether Tom waited for Mary.

I don't remember exactly, but I suppose it was Friday last week.
He talked of her kindness and humility.
Don't forget to call me up tonight.
The pencil is on the desk.
Let's go wake them up.
Tom broke his nose.
What else do you like?
It'll be a long night.
Have you tried it?
"Have you finished it?" "On the contrary, I've just begun."
I told Tom to wait for me in the lobby.
It doesn't ring a bell.

How many were there?
You need to pay attention.
Don't play that game.
The enemy kept up their attack all day.
How long have Tom and Mary been working here?
Let's just go home.
Keep it simple.
What were the chief events of last year?
Tom isn't standing.
I saw a plane.
Tom told me a strange story.
You can come whenever it's convenient for you.
Tom loves kids.
I was a witness.
Have you ever asked Tom why he likes doing that?
That's what I tried to tell him.
I can't even begin to comprehend why somebody would do something like this.
I thought you knew.
I shouldn't have married Mary.
Thank you for the cute postcard.
They didn't find it.
Give them what they want.
Where did he get that coat?
I'll tell Tom you're ready.
I'm riding with Tom.
Few Japanese can use English well.

Be there at 2:30.
You should take my advice.

What've you got?

Tom told me to ask you.
The bridge collapsed.
Why are the police here?
I don't want to lose Mary.
I am pretty pleased with you.
How was your trip to Australia?

Can you tell me when Tom'll be back?
I don't have time to argue.
I haven't eaten meat for a whole month.
The glass is empty.
Do you want to know what I think?
Tom said that Mary looks like a boy.

I have a black dog.
She took my breath away.
There's something rotten in the state of Denmark.
I recognized the name.

What's your biggest fear?
I'm stuffed.
She will notice sooner or later.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
Tom was as busy as me.
Here's one of my favorites.
They plan to do away with most of these regulations.
Please buy me three pens.
You promised you would help me.
He came as soon as he could.
It's time to eat lunch.
I don't have the slightest clue.
Tom knows how to repair computers.
Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?
I found it in the attic.
Let's eat before our dinner gets cold.
We got no thanks for all our work.
I wrote it all down.
I think Tom might win.
He robbed me of my new watch.
I read on my smartphone, because it fits in my pocket, while books don't.
That's too expensive for me.
Tom forgot his own birthday.
He's older than you think.

It is no use complaining about the weather.
We can't afford it.
Tom is hanging a picture on the wall.
We're grateful for your assistance.
Tom wanted to ask Mary to go out with him, but he didn't have the courage to.
You'll have to talk to them.

I've seen you do that.
Tom will ask you to help.
I did it with good reason.
We're not going to find her.
I want Tom to stay at home with the children.
The paper is white.
Temperatures in Oymyakon, Yakutia hit -67.7C.
The third house from the corner is Tom's.
The police are questioning several suspects in this crime.
I should have studied more.
Do you work at a hospital?
Pleasure to meet you.

I don't want you to come.
We must work hard to complete the project.
Tom told me not to do that anymore.
He doesn't like us.
I don't like this movie at all.
Not everyone seems to agree with Tom.
I'm proud of you.
If you want to come with us, you're welcome.

I can't imagine how it'll turn out.
Tom is the spitting image of his father.
Tom is fixing the car.
Please move away from the door.

Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
He misses his family.
It costs 2 euros.
Tom let the dog out.
No, Tom, don't do that.
You will give me this letter.
I squeezed Tom's hand.
I'm not asking him.
Do you want to see me again?

Don't forget to sign your name.
I don't know what to tell Tom.
Something has happened to my right eye.
I will do whatever you wish.
I saw the teacher walk across the street.
I've been looking for Tom.
What is your favourite song?
We're glad to see you.
I can recommend a good doctor.

Don't be so selfish.
They went their separate ways.

No, Dad!
Would you play with me?
I got out of bed this morning later than usual.
Were you wearing a helmet?

Please repeat the last three words.
Objection, your honor!
It's about time.
I'll be back in three hours.
Pancake! We're out of vermicelli!
Have you called the police?
No one saw Tom.
I can't stand that kind of politician.
We appreciate your interest in our company.
Do you know the reason why the sky looks blue?
Didn't you know I'd do that?
What were you going to say?
He tapered off to one cigarette a day.
We know you're still there.
You can get it at a bookstore.

Promise you won't tell them.
Maybe it's better that we don't know.

Stand back, please.
It's far-fetched.

The girl fancied herself a doctor.
Where's my suitcase?
We have a meeting room in the second floor and another one in the third floor.
What do you appreciate about yourself?
We're wasting time.
If I were you, I'd go home right away.
What time do you leave?
You look like a lawyer.
Are you younger than Tom?
I think she's in love with him.
Practice makes perfect.
Oil is scarce in this country.
My life has changed completely.
Because it inflames upper-airway tissues, smoking often leads to obstructive sleep apnoea. Alcohol and sedatives can worsen apnoea as well; acting as muscle relaxants, they make the airway smaller.

You've got to come with me.
Tom still doesn't know what he's supposed to do.

Tom has a great sense of humor.
People are very inclined to paranoia.
I tasted the wine.
Why did you drink?
I can't answer your question with any certainty.
Racist people are ignorant.

I'm sure Tom will help you.
I'll have the same.
Everyone started laughing at me.
Do it!
She said she wasn't planning to go.
You make me lose my patience.
Tom is a very wise man.
Thanks for letting us stay.
Tom couldn't believe that somebody wanted to kill him.
I hate soccer.
Which one will they choose?
Don't be cruel.
I need more help.

Where's your mother?
Innocence is a beautiful thing.
I think Tom is a cat.

Give me that thing.
Even in my native language, there are words that I don't know.
"You can know anything instantly ... if you Google it." "Google?"

Do you want to get married?
Tom will probably come.
Will you be ready?
Tom was diagnosed with ADHD.
Music is a universal language.
You look familiar.
Is that your excuse?
I hope Tom remembers us.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the combination of royal authority and priesthood in Jesus Christ.

Be quiet and listen!
I haven't understood anything.
I think Tom doesn't like to ski.

Come in.
Did you find anything interesting?
I usually sit next to Tom.
Where did your friend go?
Are you sure Tom left?
What did you eat for breakfast this morning?
What's the matter?
I know this is an unpopular opinion.
Tom put it in the box.
You need to fill out these forms.
Could you give me your name?
I believe we can do it.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean that.
I studied French in school, but I'm not very good at it.

I want an apple.
When there's a will, there's a way.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell Tom why you did that.
He isn't running.
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
We should ask Tom.
Tom still loves his job.
I learned a very valuable life lesson.
I have one big brother and two little sisters.
I tried to warn Tom.
Can you take a photo of us?
Someone is inside.
Are you going home?
Don't you want to stop her?
It's uncertain if Tom will come.
The ball hit him in the leg.
You owe him an apology.
I'm at home now.
I know Tom is brave.
Tom didn't call for help.
Who won first prize?
She goes to school on foot.
I spent all day with them.
I've decided.
I'm not going to swim anymore.
I didn't blame Tom.
Wait here until I return.
Everyone, sit down at the table.
Are you still looking for a job?
I only want to help them.
Tom embraced Mary.
I threw the book in the fire.
We are fighting an enemy we don't know.
I haven't met her.
You will be punished.
Do you know if my husband is still in the office?
You should be careful with her.
I'm anxious to see you.
My favorite subject in school is history.
These dogs are big.
Pets are permitted.

Put your hat back on.
She told me a lot about you.
I'm waiting for a letter from Tom.
How much money do we have?
You should stay away from that guy.
You can answer it.
Why don't we go there today?
Where did she get that much money?
The excitement reached its peak.
I don't think that Tom has to come tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was unlucky.
I'm Tom's fiancée.
I'm sure you're very busy.
We agreed to disagree.
You're perfectly right.
Open your eyes.
I am from Brazil.
What's wrong, Tom?
Tom is better at cooking than me.
My car's parked over there.
Tom rubbed his temples.
This office has very modern furniture.
Tom has more important things to do.
It'll be easy for you to do that.
That sounds like a threat.
Tom needs to make a decision.
Tom's name is on the list.
I'm going to stay at home tomorrow.
How long have you been watching us?
I'm not very athletic.
We'll find one.
Tom can't stand Mary's mother because she puts on airs and graces.
There is no time to explain.
Bill, open the door.
Thank you for mentioning this.
I agree to your plan.
I didn't ask whether you wanted to go.
I want to buy a new couch.
A stranger spoke to me.
I thought you might be thirsty.
Didn't you know that Tom was in Australia last week?
Tom is excited about something.
You're not likely to win.
You should be careful with her.

Even if it takes you three years, you must accomplish your goal.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
He'll need help.
I detest people who tell lies.
I flipped him the bird.
You should hurry.
Wait a sec.
Everybody's at risk.
Tom and Mary were able to help each other.
She's very impressionable.
Tom can't be here.
Tom decided not to do that.
Tom has been throwing rocks at my dog.
We laughed.
Why didn't you return?
Tom refused to go to bed.
It's perfectly legal.
My mother only had two children at the time.
How much does the blue one cost?
I want my children to go to college.

I felt a sudden pain.
I will never make such a mistake again.

We decided to stay.

The majority of what Dan is saying is correct.
It's Tom's only chance.

We had lunch early.
Tom is very decisive.
Can we meet tomorrow?
This is a sentence that has the syllable count of a haiku.
I know your father.
Tell me to leave and I'll leave.
You have to believe us.
I remember the day I met her.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
It looks like you managed to solve the problem on your own.
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
I don't want your opinion.
He loves her and me.
What a funny little animal!
That's what Tom told me.
Tom used to be my best friend.
Some plants grow well with a minimum of care.

I like listening to him.
Yes, he is an inventor, if I understood correctly.
I saw Mary with him.
I did that while you were still sleeping.
I think that it's dangerous to go walking alone at night.
I'm glad you decided to come.
Is it true that horses sleep while standing up?
I heard her singing.
Eat it while it's hot.
Don't change anything.
Where's your black suit?
I could've simply refused to do that.
Will you help me with my homework?
Nobody supports him.
Tom refused to open the door.
Ladies also play with the ball.
Tom eats lunch at this restaurant quite often.
How could you think that?

I am not in the least afraid of his threats.
He'll be back soon.
Tom needed to buy food.
I've never understood her.
Do you prefer to go by train or bus?
So, have you told them yet?
Tom convinced me that Mary was innocent.
Is it OK not to wait?
Can I have a few minutes alone?
I know you like traveling.
The faucet in the bathroom's out of order.

I will never forget your kindness so long as I live.
Can we run now?
Tom didn't know where I was.
Did you know I'm French?
You're a racist.
Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace.

My mother's brother's wife is my aunt.
Ask her to come tomorrow.
Did Tom let you drive his car?

The boy is playing with his tin soldiers.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
Why didn't Tom speak?
